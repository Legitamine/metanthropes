You can seamlessly blend with your surroundings, effectively becoming invisible as long as you remain still or move slowly without engaging in actions. However, this basic form of invisibility has its limitations. It typically lasts for several seconds, and it is relatively easy to detect, as it can be revealed by various forms of spectrum analysis, including cameras and lenses. Furthermore, this level of invisibility does not extend to making your clothing invisible, which can be a telltale sign to keen observers.</span></em></p>"

With Normalization, you can effortlessly re-establish the normal state of any abnormalities caused by the use of Metapowers in the environment or upon other individuals. An invisible aura surrounds you, constantly re-normalizing any alterations and reverting them back to their original form and shape. This remarkable effect can last for several minutes, and skilled Arbiters can even choose to exclude specific areas from the aura. However, attempting to use this power without sufficient control may result in backfiring, causing any positive changes you have made to yourself to be undone.</span></em></p>"

You can glide through the air with ease, moving toward any destination for a minute or more. While Levitate does not grant true flight, it allows the Cosmonaut to mitigate the impact of falling from great heights by smoothly levitating just before impact. The sight of someone levitating is a spectacle to behold, capable of inspiring both wonder and trepidation among unaccustomed onlookers.</span></em></p>"

While Levitate does not grant true flight, it allows the Cosmonaut to mitigate the impact of falling from great heights by smoothly levitating just before impact. The sight of someone levitating is a spectacle to behold, capable of inspiring both wonder and trepidation among unaccustomed onlookers.</span></em></p>"

These fiery barriers continue to blaze for several minutes, their intensity and persistence determined by environmental factors. Anything or anyone caught within the embrace of a Fire Wall becomes a victim of your consuming flames. Skilled practitioners of Pyrokinesis can manipulate these walls' size, their spread, and the distance from which they can be conjured. However, an inexperienced effort might ignite a wall of fire, only to see it surge back towards you.</span></em></p>"

The resultant burst of flames, akin to a flamethrower's force, engulfs anything within its wide reach. Flammable materials unfortunate enough to fall in its path are consumed by the inferno for the following minute. Nimble manipulations of this fiery torrent can extend its range and intensify the blaze's ferocity. However, a misstep might lead to an unintended consequence as the flames recoil, dancing dangerously close to your own skin. Conversely, this level of mastery can be harnessed to douse existing flames within its sphere.</span></em></p>"

The resultant burst of flames, akin to a flamethrower's force, engulfs anything within its wide reach. Flammable materials unfortunate enough to fall in its path are consumed by the inferno for the following minute. Nimble manipulations of this fiery torrent can extend its range and intensify the blaze's ferocity. However, a misstep might lead to an unintended consequence as the flames recoil, dancing dangerously close to your own skin. Conversely, this level of mastery can be harnessed to douse existing flames within its sphere.</span></em></p>"

With an activation of Enlarge, you command your body to grow dramatically in size. This metamorphosis can magnify you to the stature of an elephant, endowing you with newfound reach, extraordinary striking force, and unparalleled durability. Your clothing accommodates this expansion, fitting your larger form, while the items you hold remain unaffected. The activation of Enlarge flows effortlessly, its effects lingering for a span of one to several minutes, dictated by your innate strength. However, a misstep during activation might temporarily wear you out, preventing you from activating any uses of this Metapower.</span></em></p>"

Activating Shorten, your body undergoes a remarkable transformation, contracting in size. While this initial alteration may seem modest, it serves as a foundational step toward the potential for more drastic shifts in size. This transformation brings about not only a change in height but also in mass, rendering you notably lighter. This newfound agility complements your stealth and covert movement, allowing you to slip through the environment unnoticed. Your attire adjusts accordingly, although objects in your grasp remain unaltered. The Shorten effect flows seamlessly and persists for a variable duration, anywhere from one to several minutes. A slightly overzealous activation may leave you tired, a gentle reminder of the newfound power within.</span></em></p>"

Your teeth and nails undergo a subtle transformation, resembling fangs and claws, and you can employ these natural weapons against your adversaries. The sight of your transformed self might even strike terror into the hearts of human opponents. Those skilled in wielding this power can extend its duration and effectiveness, albeit with a minor risk of feeling a temporary hunger akin to a hungry beast.</span></em></p>"

Your eyes take on an animal-like intensity, and for the next several minutes, your perception becomes heightened. You can see distant details, hear sounds from far away, and detect scents carried by the wind. Moreover, you gain the ability to see clearly in low-light conditions and to sense the presence of blood within proximity. Any minor mishaps during the activation of Animal Senses might leave you with a slight hunger, but without further consequences.</span></em></p>"

Within this domain, you gain the power to make your target repeat their last few seconds or skip the next crucial moments. As you activate this effect, it manifests as a visible glitch, akin to a surreal moment captured on video. Witnessing such temporal anomalies can unsettle both humans and animals alike. With Temporal Glitch, you hold the power to impede the bleeding of an open wound or accelerate its flow, manipulate the timing of a device such as an alarm or detonator, or orchestrate other subtle temporal manipulations. The adept Time Bender can enhance the effect by extending its reach, targeting additional entities, or even triggering cascading events in succession. However, a failed activation of Temporal Glitch may momentarily leave&nbsp;</span>you<span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">&nbsp;disoriented, struggling to find&nbsp;</span>your<span lang=\"en-us\" xml:lang=\"en-us\">&nbsp;bearings in the tides of time.</span></em></p>"

Within this domain, you gain the power to make your target repeat their last few seconds or skip the next crucial moments. As you activate this effect, it manifests as a visible glitch, akin to a surreal moment captured on video. Witnessing such temporal anomalies can unsettle both humans and animals alike. With Temporal Glitch, you hold the power to impede the bleeding of an open wound or accelerate its flow, manipulate the timing of a device such as an alarm or detonator, or orchestrate other subtle temporal manipulations. The adept Time Bender can enhance the effect by extending its reach, targeting additional entities, or even triggering cascading events in succession.

Unlike the overt Temporal Glitch, this manipulation remains unseen to outside observers. You possess the choice to expand the duration of positive effects under your target's experience or alternatively shorten the time of their afflictions. It is important to note that Temporal Warping requires the target's willingness, although at advanced levels, the Arbiter can impose their temporal will even on unwilling individuals, nullifying their defenses or prolonging their periods of turmoil. Precise activations may amplify the effect of Temporal Warping, while careless attempts may cause a severe disorientation, momentarily jolting the Arbiter's temporal awareness.</span></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

You can brighten or dim the surroundings, creating a vibrant or subdued ambiance as desired. Moreover, you can manipulate colors to the minutest detail, altering the visual perception of objects within the affected area. The duration and reach of these effects can be expanded with skill, but the risk of backfiring and causing temporary blindness remains a concern.</span></em></p>"

You have no difficulty spotting something that could be considered harder to find due to its small size, and you can even narrow it down to targets smaller than specks of sand. This technique lasts from one to several minutes, depending on your ability to use your keen vision, but there is a small chance of it backfiring and turning you temporarily blind and disoriented for the next minute instead. This heightened level of Meta Vision allows you to become an exceptional observer and investigator, as you can notice even the tiniest details and gather information that might be overlooked by others.</span></em></p>"

You can use your extraordinary eyesight to detect the thermal signatures emitted by objects and living organisms. Using Thermal Vision, you can see into the dark with ease and locate living organisms by following the heat emitted by their bodies. This heightened level of perception enables you to detect hidden dangers, track the movement of others, and gather crucial information even in low-light conditions. However, as with previous levels of this Metapower, the effects' duration can be extended, but it can also backlash, leaving you severely disoriented and temporarily blind for a minute instead, as the intense visual input overwhelms your senses.</span></em></p>"

With keen attention, you can considerably extend the range of your zoom-in, allowing you to view much further away than is humanly possible. This enhanced vision allows you to be a sharp observer and gather crucial information from a distance. However, using Zoom-In comes with a slight risk of a mild disorientation and temporary blindness that lasts for a minute instead, as the intense focus strains your eyes.</span></em></p>"
