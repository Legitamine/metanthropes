Guided by the invisible hand of destiny, they find themselves inexplicably drawn to an aged opera house, a relic of forgotten elegance. Within its walls, an enigmatic performance unfolds. Little do they know, that each of them is a Metanthrope, gifted with a unique, extraordinary ability. What will happen, and which machinations led them there, is up to them to figure out.\"</span></p></blockquote><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Welcome, Narrators, to your exclusive realm within \"Metanthropes: Introductory Zine.\" This section is reserved for your eyes only, filled with essential \"behind-the-screen\" insights to masterfully conduct the introductory story. To preserve the thrill and mystery for Players, we advise them to steer clear of this Chapter and avoid spoilers.</p><p></p><p>Here, you'll find a treasure trove of resources:</p><p></p><p><strong>• Detailed NPCs and Antagonists: Get to know the Characters that will shape your Protagonists’ journey.</strong></p><p><strong>• Scenes and Settings: Vivid descriptions of locations and setups for each pivotal moment in the story.</strong></p><p><strong>• Dialogue and Options: Dynamic options to steer conversations and influence the story's path.</strong></p><p><strong>• Story Resolutions: Various outcomes to adapt the narrative flow and keep players engaged.</strong></p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Designed as a one-shot adventure, this story is your canvas to create an unforgettable experience. While it's tailored for a single session, feel free to expand the gameplay or continue the Protagonists adventures through the vast expanses of the Metanthropes Multiverse.</p><p></p><p>For additional insights into the rich worldbuilding and lore of Metanthropes, visit <a href=\"https://www.metanthropes.com/\">Metanthropes.com</a>.</p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The introductory adventure is more than a Session; it's a gateway. It brings together a Group of strangers, forging bonds through shared challenges and unveiling a glimpse into the grand tapestry of the Metanthropes Cosmos. Prepare to lead your players into a world of infinite possibilities, where every choice weaves into the larger narrative of Metanthropes.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h3>Behind the Curtain</h3><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Somewhere, somewhen, the Prime Timeline weaves its elusive course through the Cosmos. It is from this foundational reality that the Orchestrators—Metanthropes of near-omnipotence—have crafted an extraordinary bastion. This ethereal city, transcending the bounds of space and time, serves as a sanctuary and a vantage point.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">In this otherworldly realm, the Conductors, agents of the Orchestrators, peer across countless Timelines. Their task is monumental yet precise: to craft Timelines where new Metanthropes will emerge and to guide them into the fold of this cosmic tapestry.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The Protagonists of our story hail from disparate, “phantom” Timelines. Covertly, they are summoned by the Conductors to an opera that acts as a nexus, an inter-Timeline crossroad. Here, in this grand stage of possibilities, they are to demonstrate their prowess and potential for teamwork within a Coalition. It's a test, a challenge for them to harness their Metapowers and combine into a formidable unit.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The Conductors' ultimate goal is twofold: firstly, to introduce the Protagonists to the vast, intricate chessboard of the Multiverse—a symphony in which they are now inextricably instruments. Secondly, to present them with a choice that echoes through realities: to align with a Multiversal Faction, embark on a new Timeline and mission, or to return to their original worlds, alone.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">This choice marks a turning point, a moment of revelation and decision. It's where destinies intertwine, and the grand opera of Metanthropes unfolds, revealing the depth and breadth of a universe brimming with endless narratives and boundless adventures.</p><p></p>"

From an Immortal king who has lives tens of thousands of years, to a conduit of an entire collective of minds, they are beyond the Stats and Metapowers presented in this version of the game. The form the choose to take here is merely an avatar of who they really are.</p><p></p><h1>The Usher</h1><p></p><h3>Appearance:</h3><p></p><p>The Usher, garbed in a traditional uniform, presents a non-binary appearance, blending both feminine and masculine traits. Their red curly hair frames a youthful face, suggestive of their early twenties or late teens. Piercing teal-blue eyes stand out, accompanied by a sprinkling of pimples, adding to their youthful allure. The Usher's aura is a mix of innocence and awkwardness, tinged with playfulness and an undercurrent of mystery.</p><p></p><h3>Summary</h3><p>Background:</p><p>Metamorphosis: Self-Made</p><p>Arc: Harmonizer/Catalyst</p><p>Regression: Persona/Overenthusiasm</p><h3></h3><h3>Ⓜ️etapowers:</h3><p> Meta Evocation, Memory Manipulation, Meta Cognition, Ancestral Connection, Luck Bending, Invisibility, Warp Reality</p><p>Stats</p><p></p><p>- Body: 25 Endurance: 55 Power: 45 Reflexes: 65 Mind: 30 Creativity: 60 Manipulation: 50 Perception: 75 Soul: 20 Awareness: 55 Conscience: 25 Willpower: 60</p><p></p><h3>Multiversal Faction: (Autonomia)</h3><p>The Usher is a member of a unique Multiversal Faction, a collective of Metanthropes dedicated to nurturing and guiding those who find themselves overwhelmed by the vast expanse of the Multiverse. This Faction stands apart in its approach: rather than assigning direct missions across Timelines, it focuses on helping each Metanthrope discover and embrace their uniqueness. Emphasizing individuality, freedom, and self-expression, members of this Faction are so self-aware that they often break the fourth wall, recognizing their existence as characters within a game or simulation. Their role is not just to guide but to enlighten, empowering each Metanthrope to find their path in the cosmic tapestry.</p><p></p><h3>Roleplay:</h3><p>As the Protagonists enter the opera, the Usher, seemingly engrossed in their own world, perhaps wearing headphones, feigns ignorance of their arrival. They appear busy, typing away on a laptop, and act startled when the Protagonists eventually approach them.</p><p></p><p>With a hint of surprise, the Usher informs the group that they're late, but luckily, the performance hasn't started yet. Urging them to hurry, the Usher checks their tickets, which the Protagonists have on them, and then leads them through the hallway to the main hall's doors. After wishing them an enjoyable show, the Usher closes the doors somewhat abruptly behind them.</p><p></p><p>They will show Interest in: (any)</p><p>- Arbiter</p><p>- Animator</p><p>- Clairvoyant</p><p>- Manipulator</p><p>- Utilitarian</p><p> </p><h1>Shavo Chootakian:</h1><p></p><h3>Appearance:</h3><h3></h3><p>Shavo, an elderly figure, stands out in his retro attire reminiscent of the 1930s. He sports a round hat and a glamorous coat, adding to his distinct appearance. Despite his short stature, he commands attention with his somewhat long hair and beard. His facial features, characterized by a long forehead and a prominent jaw, are softened by a warm, inviting smile. Shavo radiates an aura of kindness mingled with mystery, making him seem exceptionally approachable and intriguing.</p><p></p><h3>Summary</h3><p>- Background:</p><p>- Metamorphosis: Meta Bloodline</p><p>- Arc: Catalyst/ Protector</p><p>- Regression: Overenthusiasm/Anachronism</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Metapowers</h3><p>- Ⓜ️: Freeze TimeGravitational AnchorMirageMorphingProtohumanSpeed ManipulationTransfer Energy</p><p></p><h3>Stats</h3><p>- Body: 25 Endurance: 55 Power: 45 Reflexes: 65 Mind: 30 Creativity: 60 Manipulation: 50 Perception: 75 Soul: 20 Awareness: 55 Conscience: 25 Willpower: 60</p><p></p><h3>Multiversal Faction:</h3><p></p><p>The Sumerian Kings, a cadre of immortal beings, have been the silent architects of human civilization across countless Timelines. Operating primarily within the enigmatic Nether Dimension, they communicate with spirits and navigate cosmic energies with ease.</p><p></p><p>Esteemed for their deep reverence for tradition and fraternity, the Sumerian Kings are custodians of lost lore and history. Their wisdom spans the ages, and their guidance has been pivotal in shaping the course of humanity. Unseen yet ever-present, they are the steadfast protectors of mankind, safeguarding the legacy and continuity of human civilization.</p><p></p><h3>Roleplay:</h3><p>Seated near the entrance at the back of the opera hall, Shavo is the picture of warmth and welcome as the Protagonists enter. His continuous, beaming smile is hard to miss, and he gestures invitingly for anyone who returns it to sit beside him. His demeanor is a blend of politeness and playful humor, making caricaturesque remarks about the delayed start of the show and nostalgically commenting, \"They don’t make performances as they used to.\"</p><p></p><p>Shavo hints at having seen this play before, teasing the Protagonists with the promise of an exciting experience ahead. Although he's clearly delighted with the situation, he remains coy, revealing nothing more until the actual performance begins.</p><p></p><p>- Aegis</p><p>- Animator</p><p>- Hammer</p><p>- Kineticist</p><p> </p><h1>Thiruvati Bhrahmani:</h1><p></p><h3>Apperance</h3><p>Thiruvati, a young girl of Asian descent in her late teens, presents a striking image. Her attire is ragged, echoing the life of someone who might be living off the streets, and notably, she wears no shoes. However, a closer inspection reveals much more. Her bright orange eyes sparkle with an unexpected depth of wisdom and brilliance, betraying a keen intellect and experience beyond her years. Her wicked smile, while disarming, carries an air of intimidation and deceit, suggesting layers of complexity and cunning in her character.</p><p></p><h3>Summary</h3><p>- Background:</p><p>- Metamorphosis: Meta Bloodline</p><p>- Arc: Protector</p><p>- Regression: Overenthusiasm</p><p></p><h3>Metapowers</h3><p>- Ⓜ️: Freeze TimeGravitational AnchorMirageMorphingProtohumanSpeed ManipulationTransfer Energy</p><p></p><h3>Stats</h3><p>- Body: 25 Endurance: 55 Power: 45 Reflexes: 65 Mind: 30 Creativity: 60 Manipulation: 50 Perception: 75 Soul: 20 Awareness: 55 Conscience: 25 Willpower: 60</p><p></p><h3>Multiversal Faction (Collectiva)</h3><p></p><p>This Faction believes in the unification of Metanthropes and humans across all renditions of Earth and every Timeline, envisioning a singular, collective existence. Operating primarily within the Astral Dimension, they harness and value psychic energies as a means to connect and unite diverse beings. Their ultimate goal is to bring about a unified leadership under the Metanthropes, guiding mankind towards a collective destiny. While their intentions are geared towards unity, they are sometimes willing to employ any means necessary to achieve this integration, revealing a complex and multifaceted approach to their mission.</p><p></p><h3>Roleplay:</h3><p>-</p><p>- In the theater hall, Thiruvati assumes the guise of a beggar, weaving through the attendees to ask for money. Her interactions are a calculated performance, eventually leading her to a Protagonist she finds particularly interesting. Persistently, she will request money from them, never satisfied with any amount given, always asking for more. This act is not just about the money; she revels in being ignored and is intent on testing the Protagonist's patience.</p><p></p><p>- As she draws closer, Thiruvati may use her telepathic abilities to intimidate the Protagonist, revealing her knowledge of their true identity. Throughout this encounter, her wicked smile remains, adding a layer of intrigue and challenge to her character.</p><p>- Arbiter</p><p>- Clairvoyant</p><p>- Manipulator</p><p>- Utilitrian</p><p></p><h1>Nikko (Quint):</h1><p></p><h3>Appearance:</h3><p>Nikko, a stunning woman of African heritage, stands tall and lean, commanding attention with her shaved head and striking appearance. Her punk-rock style is evident in her attire, featuring a leather jacket paired with fishnet stockings. In her hand, a device casts holographic images, adding a futuristic edge to her persona. Nikko radiates an aura of awe and mystery, her presence a blend of edgy style and enigmatic allure.</p><p></p><h3>Summary</h3><p>- Background:</p><p>- Metamorphosis: Meta Bloodline</p><p>- Arc: Protector</p><p>- Regression: Overenthusiasm</p><p></p><h3>Metapowers</h3><p>• Ⓜ️: Freeze TimeGravitational AnchorMirageMorphingProtohumanSpeed ManipulationTransfer Energy</p><p></p><h3>Stats</h3><p>• Body: 25 Endurance: 55 Power: 45 Reflexes: 65 Mind: 30 Creativity: 60 Manipulation: 50 Perception: 75 Soul: 20 Awareness: 55 Conscience: 25 Willpower: 60</p><p></p><h3>Multiversal Faction:</h3><p>Niko's Faction, a group of visionary explorers, delves deep into various Timelines in pursuit of technological breakthroughs. With a profound appreciation for technology, their primary focus lies in the exploration of the Aether Dimension. This Faction skillfully blends Material and Cosmic energies, directing their efforts towards the development of future technologies, progressive ideas, and innovative devices. They are the architects of tomorrow, dedicated to constructing advanced engines and decisively influencing the trajectory of future timelines.</p><p></p><h3>Roleplay:</h3><p>- Nikko Quint positions herself at a distance from the other Conductors, perched nonchalantly on her balcony seat. With her legs casually dangling over the side, she appears indifferent to the Protagonists' arrival, her attention absorbed by her device. To an observant Protagonist with a successful Performance roll, it becomes evident that Nikko's device is no ordinary cellphone; rather, it's a sleek rectangle of glass from which \"touch-screen\" holograms are projected. Throughout the initial phase, Nikko purposefully avoids interaction with the Protagonists, maintaining her focus on her holographic device, until the commencement of the Action Scene.</p><p></p><p>- Animator</p><p>- Cosmonaut</p><p>- Controller</p><p></p>",

Depending on which <strong>Antagonist</strong> is chosen, the details may vary.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The Action Scene is designed to rigorously test the Protagonists' skills, adaptability, and teamwork. Goal of this Scene, and by an extend of the Conductors, is to challenge the Protagonists. The Players must be pushed to strategically utilize their Destiny reserves, and the Protagonists are expected to receive Conditions, reduce their Life points, compel them to use their Action slots wisely, engage in Multi-Actions, make tactical repositioning, and leverage their unique abilities to their fullest.</p><p></p><h1>Challenging Players:</h1><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The Action Scene is an opportunity for each Protagonist to showcase their strengths within the Coalition.

If the Protagonists discern the illusion and confront the Conductors about the façade, acknowledging the absence of real danger, the Action Scene may conclude through this realization.</p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Alternatively, after a few Cycles of interaction, the Conductors will have gauged the Coalition's capabilities. The Conductors' objective is not to defeat the Protagonists but to stretch their abilities to the limit. Hence, once they've sufficiently assessed the Coalition's potential, they may choose to bring the scene to a close, having achieved their goal of testing the Protagonists' limits.</p><p></p>"
