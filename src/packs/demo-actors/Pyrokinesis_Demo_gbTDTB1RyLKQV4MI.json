You can glide through the air with ease, moving toward any destination for a minute or more. While Levitate does not grant true flight, it allows the Cosmonaut to mitigate the impact of falling from great heights by smoothly levitating just before impact. The sight of someone levitating is a spectacle to behold, capable of inspiring both wonder and trepidation among unaccustomed onlookers.</em></p>"

Flammable materials unfortunate enough to fall in its path are consumed by the inferno for the following minute. Nimble manipulations of this fiery torrent can extend its range and intensify the blaze's ferocity. However, a misstep might lead to an unintended consequence as the flames recoil, dancing dangerously close to your own skin. Conversely, this level of mastery can be harnessed to douse existing flames within its sphere.</em></p>"

The resultant burst of flames, akin to a flamethrower's force, engulfs anything within its wide reach. Flammable materials unfortunate enough to fall in its path are consumed by the inferno for the following minute. Nimble manipulations of this fiery torrent can extend its range and intensify the blaze's ferocity. However, a misstep might lead to an unintended consequence as the flames recoil, dancing dangerously close to your own skin. Conversely, this level of mastery can be harnessed to douse existing flames within its sphere.</em></p>"

As you move, the searing flames follow your path, transforming anything they touch into smoldering embers.
