This metamorphosis can magnify you to the stature of an elephant, endowing you with newfound reach, extraordinary striking force, and unparalleled durability. Your clothing accommodates this expansion, fitting your larger form, while the items you hold remain unaffected. The activation of Enlarge flows effortlessly, its effects lingering for a span of one to several minutes, dictated by your innate strength. However, a misstep during activation might temporarily wear you out, preventing you from activating any uses of this Metapower.</span></em></p>"

Activating Shorten, your body undergoes a remarkable transformation, contracting in size. While this initial alteration may seem modest, it serves as a foundational step toward the potential for more drastic shifts in size. This transformation brings about not only a change in height but also in mass, rendering you notably lighter. This newfound agility complements your stealth and covert movement, allowing you to slip through the environment unnoticed. Your attire adjusts accordingly, although objects in your grasp remain unaltered. The Shorten effect flows seamlessly and persists for a variable duration, anywhere from one to several minutes. A slightly overzealous activation may leave you tired, a gentle reminder of the newfound power within.</span></em></p>"

Your eyes take on an animal-like intensity, and for the next several minutes, your perception becomes heightened. You can see distant details, hear sounds from far away, and detect scents carried by the wind. Moreover, you gain the ability to see clearly in low-light conditions and to sense the presence of blood within proximity. Any minor mishaps during the activation of Animal Senses might leave you with a slight hunger, but without further consequences.</span></em></p>"

It heals you, saving you from mild medical conditions and granting you the ability to recover swiftly from minor injuries. Although its duration is short, lasting only a few seconds, skilled Aegises can harness their inner power to extend the effects of Refresh, allowing for a more prolonged period of healing and rejuvenation. The sensation of regeneration is warm and rejuvenating, akin to a gentle surge of life coursing through your veins, renewing and repairing your body with remarkable speed and efficiency.</em></p>"
