You can also carry individuals and items along with you, albeit with some limitations. Those transported through Photokinetic Movement are briefly enveloped in an intense bright light, akin to a fleeting glimpse of the sun, before being instantaneously transferred to the desired location.

Within this domain, you gain the power to make your target repeat their last few seconds or skip the next crucial moments. As you activate this effect, it manifests as a visible glitch, akin to a surreal moment captured on video. Witnessing such temporal anomalies can unsettle both humans and animals alike. With Temporal Glitch, you hold the power to impede the bleeding of an open wound or accelerate its flow, manipulate the timing of a device such as an alarm or detonator, or orchestrate other subtle temporal manipulations. The adept Time Bender can enhance the effect by extending its reach, targeting additional entities, or even triggering cascading events in succession. However, a failed activation of Temporal Glitch may momentarily leave you disoriented, struggling to find your bearings in the tides of time.</em></p>"

Within this domain, you gain the power to make your target repeat their last few seconds or skip the next crucial moments. As you activate this effect, it manifests as a visible glitch, akin to a surreal moment captured on video. Witnessing such temporal anomalies can unsettle both humans and animals alike. With Temporal Glitch, you hold the power to impede the bleeding of an open wound or accelerate its flow, manipulate the timing of a device such as an alarm or detonator, or orchestrate other subtle temporal manipulations. The adept Time Bender can enhance the effect by extending its reach, targeting additional entities, or even triggering cascading events in succession. However, a failed activation of Temporal Glitch may momentarily leave you disoriented, struggling to find your bearings in the tides of time.</em></p>"

Unlike the overt Temporal Glitch, this manipulation remains unseen to outside observers. You possess the choice to expand the duration of positive effects under your target's experience or alternatively shorten the time of their afflictions. It is important to note that Temporal Warping requires the target's willingness, although at advanced levels, the Arbiter can impose their temporal will even on unwilling individuals, nullifying their defenses or prolonging their periods of turmoil. Precise activations may amplify the effect of Temporal Warping, while careless attempts may cause a severe disorientation, momentarily jolting the Arbiter's temporal awareness.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

You possess the choice to expand the duration of positive effects under your target's experience or alternatively shorten the time of their afflictions. It is important to note that Temporal Warping requires the target's willingness, although at advanced levels, the Arbiter can impose their temporal will even on unwilling individuals, nullifying their defenses or prolonging their periods of turmoil. Precise activations may amplify the effect of Temporal Warping, while careless attempts may cause a severe disorientation, momentarily jolting the Arbiter's temporal awareness.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

With keen attention, you can considerably extend the range of your zoom-in, allowing you to view much further away than is humanly possible. This enhanced vision allows you to be a sharp observer and gather crucial information from a distance. However, using Zoom-In comes with a slight risk of a mild disorientation and temporary blindness that lasts for a minute instead, as the intense focus strains your eyes.</em></p>"

You have no difficulty spotting something that could be considered harder to find due to its small size, and you can even narrow it down to targets smaller than specks of sand. This technique lasts from one to several minutes, depending on your ability to use your keen vision, but there is a small chance of it backfiring and turning you temporarily blind and disoriented for the next minute instead. This heightened level of Meta Vision allows you to become an exceptional observer and investigator, as you can notice even the tiniest details and gather information that might be overlooked by others.</em></p>"
