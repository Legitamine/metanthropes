You can seamlessly blend with your surroundings, effectively becoming invisible as long as you remain still or move slowly without engaging in actions. However, this basic form of invisibility has its limitations. It typically lasts for several seconds, and it is relatively easy to detect, as it can be revealed by various forms of spectrum analysis, including cameras and lenses. Furthermore, this level of invisibility does not extend to making your clothing invisible, which can be a telltale sign to keen observers.</span></em></p>"

This remarkable effect can last for several minutes, and skilled Arbiters can even choose to exclude specific areas from the aura.

The effect of Reality Check lasts from one to several minutes, depending on your skill level in Metapower: Warp Reality. However, tampering carelessly with the cosmic forces governing reality can lead to a backlash, temporarily shutting down all Metapowered detections you may have activated for the following minute.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

This link can encompass multiple willing members and offers a unique means of sharing vital information. A failed attempt at Get The Message might leave you in isolation for a minute, cut off from the insights of the collective. The ethereal connection forged through Get The Message grants you a sense of belonging and camaraderie, weaving together the threads of their souls into a tapestry of shared purpose.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
