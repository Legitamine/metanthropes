The Metamorphosis of a Metanthrope can take various forms - a single profound event, an ongoing process, a latent power that has existed since childhood, or a recent experience just before the beginning of the Saga.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>This Metamorphosis bestows upon your Protagonist their first Metapower, known as the Prime Metapower.</strong> The catalyst for a Metanthrope's Metamorphosis can be a driving force that motivates and defines their personality, or it could be a haunting memory from their past that they try to bury. Each Metanthrope's Metamorphosis is unique, and even those who share the same category of Metamorphosis can experience it and be influenced by it in vastly different ways.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Below, you will find ten different options for Metamorphosis. Consider these as suggestive ideas to build the foundation of your Protagonist's journey, rather than rigid guidelines for your roleplay. Each entry provides a brief introduction explaining how the Metamorphosis could have occurred in your Protagonist's life. Following the introduction of each option, there is a section called Roleplay Implications, which explores how the Metamorphosis may potentially shape your Protagonist's emotions, worldview, and interactions with the environment and others. For each Metamorphosis option, ten Prime Metapower recommendations are provided, but players are free to choose any combination of Metamorphosis and Prime Metapower that aligns with their Protagonist's profile. <strong>Drawing inspiration from the structure and concepts presented in the following options, Players can also collaborate with the Narrator to create their own unique Metamorphosis.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Cosmic Connection</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Your Metapowers are bestowed upon you by a cosmic source that exists beyond the confines of this world. The origin of your Cosmic Connection could be extraterrestrial or extradimensional in nature. Your Metamorphosis may have been triggered by an encounter with a cosmic phenomenon, interaction with a Spirit from another Dimension, a comet passing by, celestial alignment, or communication with an alien species, among other otherworldly sources. Since your Metamorphosis, you have been introduced to a vast and unfamiliar world, to which you feel a deep and profound connection.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplay Implications:</strong> Metanthropes with a Cosmic Connection as their Metamorphosis often have a heightened awareness of the intangible forces that shape reality. They are drawn to explore and understand the mysteries of the larger cosmos rather than focusing solely on the mundane world. They may urge the Coalition to explore the cosmos, emphasizing its importance over interference with human affairs. Alternatively, they may become consumed by their desire to re-establish their personal connection to the cosmic source, driving them to embark on personal investigations.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><i class=\"fa-kit fa-metanthropes\"></i>Prime Metapower recommendations:</strong> Aether Projection, Antikinesis, Augment Metapower, Control Density, Dark Energy Projection, Inner Dimension, Order Bending, Portal Projection, Singularity Powers, Time Bending, Transfer Metapower</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Dark Pact</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Through greed, coercion, or desperate circumstances, you have entered into a binding agreement with a malevolent entity, forging a Dark Pact that grants you Metapowers. The source of your newfound abilities is a mysterious being with overwhelming capabilities that has chosen to bestow you with a portion of its power. Your Metamorphosis may have been a conscious choice, a bargain struck to gain Metapowers, or you may have been thrust into the Pact without fully understanding its implications. This Dark Pact has irrevocably changed you, granting you extraordinary abilities that always come with a price.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplay Implications:</strong> Metanthropes with a Dark Pact as their origin may find themselves unwittingly serving the whims of a malevolent entity, or they may actively conceal the details of their Metamorphosis from other members of the Coalition. Some may constantly struggle to free themselves from the clutches of their Dark Pact, requiring assistance and support from their fellow Metanthropes. On the other hand, there are those who fully embrace their role and willingly submit to the desires of their dark masters, putting their world or Timeline at grave risk.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><i class=\"fa-kit fa-metanthropes\"></i>Prime Metapower recommendations:</strong> Chaos Bending, Craft Disease, Illusion Manipulation, Mirror Metapower, Negate Metapower, Nether Projection, Reanimation, Retrocognition, Warp Reality, Weaken Metapower</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Elemental Connection</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Your Metapowers derive from the very planet you inhabit or from neighboring celestial bodies such as the moon or the sun. It could be the result of encountering a powerful storm in the middle of the ocean, discovering a mystical cave deep within the earth, consuming a strange fruit found in the jungle, encountering a unique creature in a forest, or connecting with the energy of the atmosphere. This Elemental Connection may have been established through a rare and singular event or through an ongoing affinity with a particular element, plant, animal, or the circle of life.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplay Implications:</strong> Metanthropes with an Elemental Connection as their Metamorphosis prioritize the well-being of the natural world over the concerns of humanity. Depending on the exact source of their Metapowers, they may be drawn to environments where their associated element is abundant. Their connection could be linked to a specific elemental or natural force found within their environment. They view harm to their connected element as a personal affront and may align themselves with Coalitions dedicated to the protection and preservation of nature.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><i class=\"fa-kit fa-metanthropes\"></i>Prime Metapower recommendations:</strong> Acidokinesis, Aerokinesis, Animate Plants, Control Earth, Control Weather, Planetary Powers, Solar Imitation, Substance Generation, Thermal Powers, Zoopathy</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Freak Accident</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Your transformation into a Metanthrope is the result of a series of unforeseen and random events, known as a Freak Accident. This sudden and unexpected occurrence could be triggered by a temporal anomaly, a quantum confluence, an unpredictable series of events, exposed to radioactive energy, or even collateral damage in a conflict between Omnipowered beings. The Freak Accident abruptly and irrevocably changes your life, leaving everyone astonished by the transformation, as it appears to be outside of anyone‚Äôs machinations.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplay Implications:</strong> Metanthropes who have undergone a Freak Accident may carry the trauma of their experience, forever haunted by the events that led to their Metamorphosis. For others, the Freak Accident may give their life newfound purpose and define their identity. Some Metanthropes may dedicate themselves to preventing such accidents from happening again, while others may become obsessed with recreating the circumstances. The behavior and mindset of each Metanthrope will vary depending on the nature of their Freak Accident and the events surrounding it.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><i class=\"fa-kit fa-metanthropes\"></i>Prime Metapower recommendations:</strong> Control Dark Matter, Control Kinetic Energy, Craft Toxin, Electrokinesis, Light Projection, Meta Hearing, Pyrokinesis, Radiokinesis, Random Metapower, Seismokinesis</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Material Connection</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Your Metapowers are derived from a tangible source found within the Material Dimension, such as an object made of physical matter. It could be a cursed amulet, a lucky coin, or an ancient artifact with mystical properties. Alternatively, the Material Connection could be linked to any technological means, such as a high-tech gadget, a weapon, or a piece of armor. This connection could have been established by interacting with an item, vising a physical location, or utilizing any piece of technology to unlock your Metapowers.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplay Implications:</strong> Metanthropes with a Material Connection as their Metamorphosis origin tend to be fixated on their source of power. If it's an object, they may carry it with them at all times or rely on it to access their abilities. If it is located at a specific location, it must be visited frequently. If it has mystical or advanced technological properties, it have to be further researched, and it must never fall into the wrong hands. These Metanthropes may prioritize the preservation and protection of their Material Connection, often aligning themselves with Coalitions that share this focus.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><i class=\"fa-kit fa-metanthropes\"></i> Prime Metapower recommendations:</strong> Control Matter, Detect Matter, Duplicate Object, Duplicate Self, Forcefield Generation, Invisibility, Luck Bending, Meta Speed, Sizeshift</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Meta Bloodline</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Your Metanthrope status is rooted in your bloodline, with the Metapowers flowing within your veins from generations past. Whether you were born with these abilities or unlocked them later in life, they are an innate part of you. The lineage of Metanthropes in your family tree, whether known or unknown, plays a significant role in your Metamorphosis. It connects you to a heritage that can be traced back to the origins of these extraordinary powers, and you have the potential to pass them down to future generations.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplay Implications:</strong> Metanthropes of a Meta Bloodline are often deeply curious about their family history and seek to honor the traditions and legacy of their lineage. They might keep the existence of their ancestry a secret, or carry it with pride. Uncovering the secrets and stories of their ancestors becomes a driving force in their journey. Their pursuit of self-discovery, the preservation of their bloodline, and its succession to future generations, may lead such Metanthropes to make decisions that involve the fate of the Coalition , whether they want it or not.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><i class=\"fa-kit fa-metanthropes\"></i> Prime Metapower recommendations:</strong> Biomorphic Powers, Hydrokinesis, Immortality, Life Restoration, Lunar Connection, Meta Strength, Meta Taste, Meta Touch, Pheromone Manipulation, Precognition</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Psychic Connection</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Your Metapowers originate from the intangible and unseen realms, specifically from a Psychic Connection that exists within your mind or any Psychic-based Dimension. This connection could manifest as telepathic communication with an mysterious entity or a collective consciousness, hearing a voice during meditation or prayer, being the receiver of a signal emission, or experiencing dreams that materialize into reality. The source of your Psychic Connection may have an influence on your actions or simply act as a transmitter of powerful Psychic energies, the reasons for which remain unknown to you.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplay Implications:</strong> Metanthropes with a Psychic Connection as their Metamorphosis origin are drawn to the realm of thoughts, emotions, and the collective consciousness of sentient beings. They may find themselves navigating the complexities of society, taking on leadership roles or becoming outcasts due to their unique abilities. Their behavior within society is diverse, with some using their powers for manipulation and control, others for self-discovery and testing their limits, while others might strive to guide others into esoteric journeys into the recesses of their mind.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><i class=\"fa-kit fa-metanthropes\"></i> Prime Metapower recommendations:</strong> Ancestral Connection, Animate Objects, Astral Projection, Detect Metapower, Memory Manipulation, Mind Control, Mind Swap, Spirit Manipulation, Telekinesis, Telepathy</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Scientific Experiment</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Your transformation into a Metanthrope is the result of a Scientific Experiment conducted on you. Whether as a willing volunteer or a coerced participant, you became the subject of experimental procedures or treatments that unlocked your Metapowers. The circumstances surrounding your Scientific Experiment could range from unexpected positive results to unforeseen consequences, to an experiment gone wrong. You may have been the first test subject, known as patient zero, subjected to years of experimentation. The experiment could be biogenetic, or cybernetic in nature, or tampering with forces unknown.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplay Implications:</strong> The circumstances of the Scientific Experiment shape a Metanthrope's development and outlook. Their behavior could vary from victim mentalities to eerie determined personalities. Metanthropes who were forced into the experiment may seek to find the reason why, or retribution against those who exploited them, even if they gained Metapowers as a result. On the other hand, Metanthropes who volunteered for the experiment may feel a sense of responsibility to protect and assist the organization or individuals conducting the experiments.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><i class=\"fa-kit fa-metanthropes\"></i>Prime Metapower recommendations:</strong> Alter Energy, Alter Sound, Atomokinesis, Control Gravity, Control Magnetism, Dark Energy Projection, Quantum Projection, Substance Imitation, Teleport</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Selective Evolution</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Your Metanthrope existence is the result of a significant leap in evolution. Due to a rare genetic mutation, your DNA contains the encrypted secrets of your incredible abilities. Your Metapowers might have manifested at adolescence, or after a specific event in your life, that pushed you to your limits. You may be part of a new generation of Metapowered people, or the first of your kind, representing the next step in the evolutionary chain. Your Metapowers are innate, evolved on their own, and an integral part of your being, forever tying you to the evolution of your species.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplay Implications:</strong> Metanthropes with Selective Evolution as their Metamorphosis often view themselves as free, independent beings. Although there might be some who have not embraced their newfound status yet, others consider themselves fortunate or superior to others who require gadgets or external means to activate their Metapowers. However, they are also aware that their genetic uniqueness makes them targets for study and potential replication. These Metanthropes often find camaraderie, and a sense of community and understanding among others of their kind, forming strong connections.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><i class=\"fa-kit fa-metanthropes\"></i>Prime Metapower recommendations:</strong> Adaptive Imitation, Elasticity, Flight, Intangibility, Meta Reflexes, Meta Smell, Meta Vision, Regeneration, Shapeshift</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Self-Made</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>You are solely responsible for your Metapowers, which you have achieved through your own efforts and ingenuity. Whether through a spiritual awakening, intense training, a ritualistic encounter, or devotion to a specific practice, you have intentionally and purposefully become a Metanthrope. You are the sole responsible for unlocking your Metapowers, and you have achieved it through hard work, and dedication. By unveiling your abilities to the world, you also reveal your method of becoming a Metanthrope, which may be unique to you and potentially coveted or exploited by others.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplay Implications:</strong> Self-Made Metanthropes tend to be highly competent, eccentric, secretive, and independent individuals. Most likely, they will continue to practice the way that caused their Metamorphosis. They attract the attention and curiosity of human and Metanthrope society, often considering themselves part of it. The knowledge, the process, and the method of their Self-Made Metamorphosis may lead them to form alliances within a Coalition for protection against those who seek to uncover their secrets or cause them harm.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><i class=\"fa-kit fa-metanthropes\"></i> Prime Metapower recommendations:</strong> 6th Sense, Hypnotic Manipulation, Meta Charisma, Meta Cognition, Meta Empathy, Meta Evocation, Meta Ingenuity, Meta Will</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p>"

The Arc embodies the archetype your Protagonist represents.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Successfully roleplaying your Protagonist's Arc in each Scene will earn you Destiny, based on in-game circumstances and your level of engagement. By roleplaying your Arc, you fulfill your Protagonist's destiny and follow the path they are meant to tread.</strong> Players have the freedom to change their Protagonist's Arc at the end of each Act of a Saga if their current Arc no longer aligns with their Metanthrope. This change symbolizes growth, development, and maturity in the Metanthrope's journey.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Below, you will find ten sample Arc options. It's important to note that two Metanthropes with the same Arc can subscribe to opposing ideologies yet approach problems in similar ways and employ similar methods. Each entry provides a brief introduction to how the Arc impacts roleplay from the Protagonist's perspective. Following the introduction, there is a section called Roleplay Implications, which describes how the Arc may influence a Protagonist's emotions, worldview, and interactions with the environment and others. Lastly, guidelines on earning Destiny through roleplaying each Arc are provided. <strong>Players may choose any of the ten Arc options presented or collaborate with the Narrator to create their own, drawing inspiration from and following the structure of the options below.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Architect</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>You are a creator and innovator, able to conceive groundbreaking designs and pioneer the blueprints of the future. You yearn to construct everlasting structures, develop innovative devices, and establish new theories. As an Architect, your purpose is to solve problems by offering fresh solutions, articulating your ideas, and bringing them to life.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Architects are known for their out-of-the-box thinking and their ability to provide new ideas to the Coalition. They formulate plans, and they can be the ones who build the means to complete them. They thrive in times of peace and prosperity, when they have the time and freedom to design and construct. There is always something waiting to be created that can contribute to a solution.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you contribute new theoretical or practical solutions to established problems. Gain additional Destiny when your plans, designs, or constructions have a tangible impact on the lives of others.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Autocrat</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Your destiny is to rule over humans and Metanthropes alike, under a single banner and cause - your own. You always gravitate towards commanding roles and embrace the responsibilities of decision-making. The weight of leadership may be heavy, but you believe that you are the only one worthy of shouldering it. This world deserves better leadership, and it is your destiny to provide it.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Autocrats often strive to gain control over the Coalition they are part of. They may employ political maneuvering to establish their sovereignty. Once in power, some Autocrats use their authority to inspire and enact positive change, while others demand absolute sovereign and become dictators. Autocrats understand that their path is long and treacherous, and many might challenge their authority along the way.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny when your leadership proves beneficial, and when your decision-making is proven to be the best course of action. Gain additional Destiny when new individuals willingly accept your leadership.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Catalyst</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>As a Catalyst, your driving force is to seek profound change and transformation, both within yourself and in the environment and people around you. You are constantly pushing for progress, challenging the status quo, and catalyzing shifts in beliefs, systems, and ideologies. For you nothing remains static, and old institutions must undergo profound change. Your purpose is to ignite a spark of revolution in others and reshape the world.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Catalysts are charismatic, influential, and inspiring individuals who naturally compel others to take action. They possess a unique talent for identifying the potential in people and situations, inspiring social change, and guiding others on personal journeys of growth and self-discovery. Their very presence has a transformative effect, pushing everything towards evolution and profound shifts in reality.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you inspire others and initiate change in the environment or people's lives.

You strive to bridge divides and find common ground, even in the face of deep-seated conflicts. Your ultimate goal is to bring together disparate groups, foster understanding, and create a harmonious coexistence that benefits all.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Harmonizers excel in negotiations, and peacekeeping efforts. They navigate complex social dynamics and address the concerns of both sides, working towards diplomatic solutions to conflicts. Harmonizers actively seek to mend broken relationships, facilitate dialogue, and promote cooperation. Their role may involve mediating conflicts, forging alliances, and representing the interests of their Coalition in social interactions.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny when you mediate conflicts, forge alliances, and promote understanding among different factions.

It is your role to inform the rest of the world about upcoming changes, threats, or opportunities. Whether you are a prophet of impending disaster or an evangelist of the new world order, it is your task to convince others to heed your call.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Heralds may receive glimpses of the future through encounters with Omnipotent beings, their own visions, or through extensive studies and calculations. Their duty is to share their discoveries with others, starting within their own Coalition. Heralds do not determine the course of action; instead, they act as messengers, sharing their insights.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny when you convince others of your visions, studies, or encounters.

Every enigma you encounter is a case to be solved. Your purpose is to delve into the research, study, uncover clues, connect the dots, and unravel the puzzles presented to you. Since your Metamorphosis, you have been exposed to a plethora of cosmic secrets and paradoxes, and you are driven to solve them.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Investigators are driven individuals who are willing to push boundaries and break rules in pursuit of solving their cases. Obsessed Investigators prioritize their investigations above all else, often causing disruptions within their Coalition. The thrill of solving mysteries, deciphering codes, and uncovering hidden truths motivates Investigators more than anything else.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny when you solve mysteries, puzzles, riddles, learn secrets, or uncover conspiracies. Gain additional Destiny when you display unwavering determination and go to any lengths necessary to find the answers you seek.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Naturalist</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>As a Naturalist, you have fully embraced the primordial way and the connection with the untamed forces of nature. You find solace and purpose in the raw beauty and wisdom of the natural world. Your heart beats in symphony with the rhythms of the earth, and you hold a deep reverence for the delicate balance of nature. Your mission is to protect and preserve the natural order, advocating for the well-being of animals, plants, and ecosystems.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Naturalists immerse themselves in the wild expanses, finding communion with nature and its inhabitants. They reject the trappings of society, embracing tranquility. Often found in the heart of untouched wilderness, they observe the intricacies of the natural world, seeking to deepen their understanding of its wonders.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you champion the preservation of pristine wilderness, safeguard lifeforms, and restore the environment.

Your yearning is to become the apex predator, dominating the food chain wherever you find yourself. The awakening of your Metanthrope status has unleashed the feral hunter within you, and everyone you meet is potential prey. The world becomes your domain, and you live for the thrill of the hunt.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Predators have a tendency to disregard agendas and causes, instead following their instincts. They view the world as their hunting ground, caring little for rules, morality, or social structures. While Predators can prove challenging companions within a non-like-minded Coalition, their skills in tracking down and eliminating threats make them invaluable assets.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you embrace your inner savage and showcase your superiority your peers. Gain additional Destiny when you successfully hunt down worthy prey or neutralize threats to their domain.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Protector</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>As a Protector, the Metapowers bestowed upon you serve a noble purpose: to protect those who cannot protect themselves. You stand vigilant in the face of any threat, regardless of the odds. Defending those you care about is its own reward, and it is your duty to be there when they are in need, shielding them from harm at any cost.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> The focus of a Protector's care could be a specific person or group of beings, a place, an item, or even an ideal. Their caretaking nature often extends to all members of the Coalition, and anyone around them not capable of defending themselves. Protectors prioritize everyone being safe, above the completion of any mission.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny when you successfully prevent harm from befalling to those you are meant to protect, especially in dire, life-threatening situations. Gain additional Destiny whenever you risk your own life and well-being to fulfill your protective duties.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Wayfarer</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>As a Wayfarer, your purpose as a Metanthrope is to explore new lands, planets, star systems, galaxies, and Dimensions. Nothing holds you back from boldly venturing into uncharted territories. Your quest is to witness indescribable celestial phenomena and be the first to visit undiscovered landscapes of this world and beyond.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Navigators typically oversee exploration and transportation within their Coalition. They usually have the means to directly visit extraterrestrial or extradimensional locations and transport themselves and other Coalition members between locations. For a Wayfarer, exploration, discovery, and adventure are the ultimate pursuits.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you discover new locations, landscapes, climates, cultures, civilizations, and encounter entities native to these unexplored realms.

It encompasses the reversion to human behaviors, quirks, and attachments that persist despite their ascension.</strong> Regressions can manifest as unique knacks, idiosyncrasies, nostalgic attachments, or self-imposed restrictions. It is important to recognize that Regression is not considered a weakness, as it can be a source of strength, adding depth, drama, complexity, and inner conflict to a Metanthrope‚Äôs roleplay.

Additionally, guidelines for earning Destiny through roleplaying each Regression are provided. <strong>While Players can choose from the ten pre-defined Regression options, they are also encouraged to collaborate with the Narrator to create unique Regressions that align with the structure of the options presented below.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Anachronism</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>The Anachronism Regression manifests as an anachronistic attachment, a deep affinity for a specific time period or historical era. This attachment is not limited to the past but could extend to the future instead. You are drawn to the customs, fashion, art, and ideals of their chosen era. Their anachronistic tendencies are evident in your appearance, speech, and choice of activities, making you stand out from others.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Metanthropes with the Anachronism Regression bring a unique perspective on time to their interactions and experiences. Their knowledge of history or understanding of future trends and technologies allow them to provide valuable insights and alternative solutions in various situations. However, their anachronistic nature can also pose challenges when navigating contemporary society.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you seamlessly blend elements from different eras into your daily life. Gain additional Destiny when your anachronistic tendencies lead to unexpected opportunities whether it be through uncovering wisdom from the past or foreseeing future developments.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Artisan</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>As a Metanthrope with the Artisan Regression, you find solace and fulfillment in pursuing a hobby or talent that has nothing to do with your Metapowers. Whether it's singing, writing, painting, or any other creative pursuit, this passion provides you with a sense of balance and a connection to your human side. Amidst the complexities of your new existence, you hold onto the simplicity and joy that this hobby brings.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Metanthropes with the Artisan Regression are often seen as eccentric, immersed in their craft and lost in their own world. They seek to refine their talent, dedicating time to training and seeking guidance to further their artistry. Their focus on their art can make them seem detached from the concerns of the Metanthrope world. However, their artistic expression offers perspective to the experiences of the Coalition.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny when you express themselves artistically, even in perilous times when others may overlook the importance of such pursuits. Gain additional Destiny when you inspire others to appreciate the beauty and significance found in creative expression.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Beloveds</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Your love interest is the most important thing in your life. It can be your significant other, your human family or best friend, or even your pet. You hold your loved ones in higher esteem than even your Coalition, your Metanthrope status, or even your own life. Others might misunderstand your reasoning, your motives, and your methods, but they may never have felt the way you do about your beloved.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Metanthropes with Beloveds in their lives want to keep them close and safe at all times. Such Metanthropes could prove to be extra motivated and helpful to the Coalition, especially if the task at hand will bring joy or benefits their Beloveds. Issues may arise when this bond is maintained at inappropriate times, in ways that may jeopardize the Coalition.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you can include your Beloveds in your everyday life and show your appreciation for them. Gain additional Destiny when you manage to keep them close to you even during life-threatening or bizarre situations.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Consensus</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>You are greatly concerned with your reputation and how humans view Metanthropes. It is paramount that Metanthropes are seen in a positive light and maintain a good relationship with the humans of the world they share. You must clean up the messes caused by Metanthropes that do not share your values, and sometimes, this may involve concealing massive scandals that have the potential to taint the Metanthrope reputation.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Metanthropes fixated on public Consensus will spend a lot of their time crafting their public image and painting their Coalition and the Metanthrope community in a good light. They will abide by human laws, and customs, and push other Coalition members to do so. Such Metanthropes will do anything to keep and maintain a clean image, even if it is only an illusion.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you showcase the proper image for all Metanthropes worldwide through your opinions and even more so, your actions. Gain additional Destiny whenever you convince your Coalition and any other Metanthropes to behave accordingly.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Disbelief</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>You are in a state of disbelief regarding the latest events happening in your life. Ever since the incident, which others call your Metamorphosis, you witness and experience unexplainable things. Even if Metanthropes are real, you do not feel like you are one of them. You could be hallucinating, the victim of an elaborate prank, trapped in a dream, or simply questioning your sanity.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Many Metanthropes express this Regression during the first days after their Metamorphosis. Others, due to a variety of reasons, still maintain this Disbelief long after. These reasons could include lack of evidence, a traumatic event, distrust of oneself, or the perception that their Metapowers have not manifested in a way that is perceivable and understood.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you manage to reasonably convince yourself that you are not a Metanthrope (even when you activate Metapowers). Gain additional Destiny whenever your arguments and points manage to convince or perplex other Metanthropes about their nature or their reality.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Heritage</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>With the Heritage Regression, you maintain a deep connection to your cultural or ancestral roots. The traditions, customs, and values of your Heritage hold great significance for you, serving as a source of your identity. Your upbringing and cultural background continues to shape your worldview and influence your actions. The legacy of your forebears resonates within you, guiding your values, choices, and sense of self.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Metanthropes with the Heritage Regression actively preserve and promote their cultural heritage within the Coalition. They engage in cultural practices, celebrate festivals, and seek connections with others who share their heritage. Embracing their lineage, they navigate the delicate balance between personal desires and the expectations of tradition.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny when you make decisions that honor or align with your family's legacy or ancestral traditions. Gain additional Destiny when you confront challenges and dilemmas that test your commitment to your legacy, prioritizing actions that uphold the values of your heritage.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Materialism</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>You are a slave to your unquenching thirst for material wealth. You are drawn to commodities, money, gems, souvenirs, trinkets, indulgences, and gadgets. With your Metapowers, you can now have the things you craved as a human: luxurious commodities, a lavish lifestyle, and all the marbles. You can finally use your newfound Metapowers to obtain everything you ever wanted.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Metanthropes regressing to Materialism will hoard any item they are after, often endangering their Coalition to obtain them. They expressed a repressed desire to riches and wealth, that was often devoid from their human lives. Intangible rewards mean little to them in comparison to the shiny things they desire. Materialist Metanthropes will rarely join a mission without any physical reward, even if the world is at stake.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you obtain material wealth you could never obtain as a human. Gain additional Destiny when you convince others to help you in your treasure hunts or willingly hand over their unwanted material wealth.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Overenthusiasm</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Turning out to be a Metanthrope was the best thing that ever happened to you, by far. You do not understand how each other Metanthrope is not equally thrilled about having Metapowers. From a young age, you yearned to have extraordinary abilities and continued daydreaming about superpowers as an adult. Now you cannot wait to share your enthusiasm with the rest of your kin and the whole world too.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Overenthusiastic Metanthropes will trouble other Metanthropes they encounter and brazenly ask about their Metapowers and showcase their own at every opportunity. For some Coalition members, this ever-burning flame is merely annoying, and for others, it is completely draining. Even so, overenthusiastic Metanthropes tend to boost Coalition morale.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you express your Overenthusiasm, at inappropriate, or perilous times. Gain additional Destiny whenever you infect others, especially those outside of your Coalition with your Overenthusiasm.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Persona</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Each time you publicly present yourself as a Metanthrope or activate your Metapowers in the presence of others, you must do so under an alias, an alter ego, or a secret identity ‚Äì your Persona. You must use your Persona to hide from society. You must make sure no one finds out your identity, leave no clue to trace back to you, and no witnesses who can expose your identity.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> The reason behind having a Persona is to ensure that there are no correlations between you as Metanthrope and the identity they try to maintain a secret in society. The deeper reasoning could vary from individual to individual, but the drive behind any Metanthrope with this Regression is the same. The fewer people they know, the better, even among Coalition members.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you achieve maintaining your identity as a secret while getting involved in the Coalition's activities as your Alter Ego. Gain additional Destiny whenever you are exposed to many eyes and still manage to maintain your secret.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Suppressed</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>You are afraid to use your Metapowers. Like a cannon made of glass, as soon as you fire, you feel as if you are going to crack. You envy other Metanthropes who use their Metapowers freely without consequences because, for you, there is always a price to pay when activating them. Using your Metapowers always takes a toll on you, and possibly others.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Metanthropes with the Suppressed Regression can vary from extremely gifted individuals who cannot moderate their powers to those who have experienced a traumatic shock when they first activated their Metapowers. These Metanthropes are convinced that using their Metapowers is dangerous for themselves and for those around them.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you manage to survive and get by without using your Metapowers while remaining a useful member of your Coalition. Gain additional Destiny whenever using your Metapowers end up causing wreaks havoc.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p>"

Perks give access to specific techniques, information, fields of study, and technical know-how on order to use certain Possessions. <strong>Furthermore, Perks offers additional depth and development to a Protagonist, which differs from their Metapowered arsenal.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Perks are categorized into Knowledge and Skills. <strong>Knowledge refers to abilities developed through studying theories, learning thesis and theorems, and performing simulations and experiments. Skills refer to abilities that develop through practical appliance, repetition and practicing them in the field.</strong> The following table showcases the 10 Perks which consist of 5 Knowledge and 5 Skills.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><img src=\"systems/metanthropes/assets/artwork/tables/perks.webp\" class=\" centered\" /><p style=\"text-align:center\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Perks are neither tied to any Metapower, nor to any Stat.</strong> A Character in possession of the Metapower: Control Gravity does not necessarily mean that they have to possess the Knowledge: Science. Having both of them might offer a certain circumstantial edge, according to the situation in-game and the Narrator‚Äôs discretion. Similarly, the Knowledge: Medicine could be applied when attempted a Perception roll to diagnose a medical condition, and to a Creativity roll whenever attempting to patch-up an open wound.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Unlocking &amp; Progressing Perks</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Perks range from Level 1 (novice) to Level 5 (master). Newly created Protagonists start the game with two (or possibly more, depending on their story) Perks offered by the Narrator without the need to spend any Experience. After each Act of a Saga, additional free Perks may be offered, according to the achievements and studies of the Protagonist, at the Narrator's discretion. <strong>The Experience cost of unlocking the first level in a new Perk and progressing it to higher levels is 100 per level unlocked or progressed.</strong> Since learning new Perks takes time, besides spending the Experience, a Character who wishes to advance a Perk once the story began, must spend some time in-game training and honing their craft. This time can usually be spent during any Downtime of the story.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>After the story has began, a Character can spend time training by studying handbooks, receiving tutoring, participating in lectures, watching seminars, and practicing every day.</strong> The amount of time required is based on whether the Perk is a Knowledge or a Skill (Knowledges require significantly more amount of time), and the desired Perk level, as seen in the following table.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>A Character which is spending time training, must spend the majority of the day focusing on their training.</strong> It is possible to reduce the in-game time requirements through Metapowered means (such as the Metapowers Meta Evocation and Meta Intelligence) and, at the Narrator‚Äôs discretion, through other in-game shortcuts, such as being taught by an extraordinary tutor or by allowing Downtime rolls to decrease the amount of total time needed.</p><p></p><img src=\"systems/metanthropes/assets/artwork/tables/perks-time-required.webp\" class=\" centered\" /><p style=\"text-align:center\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Unlocking and advancing a Perk for a new Protagonist</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>I created a new Protagonist and want to have Artistry at Level 3; I must spend a total of 300 Experience.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Advancing a Perk during a Downtime</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>During a Downtime I spend 200 Experience to advance my Knowledge: Engineering from Level 2 to Level 4. Additionally, my Protagonist spends a total of One Year and Six Months of training in-game time.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">For more about gaining and spending Experience, see @UUID[.mStXk1UPdF9zzQZQ]{<i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-chart-line-up\"></i> Experience}</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Knowledge</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Each level of a Perk: Knowledge, offers the Character unlocking or progressing it a field of study. A field of study is a specialization the Character has within the greater field of Knowledge. Each Knowledge listed below offers a list of available fields of study, but a Player may, in collaboration with the Narrator, come up with their own fields of study. <strong>Having a Knowledge at higher level not only gives access to further fields of study, but also increases the Character's overall mastery of a certain Perk.</strong> Using some Possessions or making certain computations in-game requires having a specific knowledge level. Characters attempting to use an Item, or a technique without having attained the required Knowledge level, cannot attempt that roll. At the Narrator‚Äôs discretion, Protagonists who have spent significant amount of time learning something in-game, may attempt a Knowledge-based roll with a Penalty.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>How Knowledge requirements function</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>I want my Protagonist to estimate the trajectory of a space rocket entering the atmosphere. The Narrator informs me that my Protagonist requires having the Knowledge: Engineering with a selected field of study at rocket propulsion, and the Knowledge: Science with astrophysics as a selected field of study. Additionally, the Narrator decides that both Knowledges need to be at level 4 or higher to make the appropriate correct calculations, and correctly estimate the rocket‚Äôs projection.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"></p><h3>Academics</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Academics offer a Character access to educational, cultural, social, and historical fields of knowledge.</strong> In addition to the fields of study, each Level at Academics provides the Character with additional foreign languages.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Example fields of study:</strong> Psychology, Anthropology, Philosophy, Sociology, Literature, Linguistics, Hieroglyphics, Archeology, Law, History</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><ol start=\"0\"><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Your Academic knowledge is equivalent to that of a high-school graduate.

Additionally, you can know up to five languages in total.</em></p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>You are a well-established intellectual, with wide-ranging influence that can challenge established theorems. Your Academic knowledge is equivalent to that of an established professor with multiple degrees. Additionally, you can know you can know up to ten languages in total.</em></p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>You are a phenom intellectual of your time. If you wanted, you could be touring the most famous universities as an honored speaker or write a book that would instantly become a bestseller. Additionally, you know up to you can know up to twenty languages in total.</em></p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Your Academic knowledge has no limits. You can use your superior academic and cultural education to promote new ideologies, gain a large following, and incite spiritual, philosophical, or political revolutions. Additionally, you can know dozens of languages including ancient and long-forgotten ones.</em></p></li></ol><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h3>Engineering</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Engineering offers a Character access to architectural and design capabilities and craftmanship in order to forge, repair or construct any Possession.</strong> Engineering includes both blueprint drafting and construction skills. In addition to the fields of study, each Level at Engineering provides the Character with the ability to certain forms of structural damage.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Examples fields of study:</strong> Architecture, Masonry, Blacksmithing, Carpentry, Forgery, Cartography, Trap-crafting, Structural Design, Car Engines, Weapon-smithing, Lock-smithing</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><ol start=\"0\"><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\">You are proficient with a hammer and can probably assemble and construct a furniture while reading instructions, but anything more complex could prove a martyrdom.</p></li></ol><ol><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\">You are handy with a variety of different tools, and capable of repairing most structural damages without the need of a structural engineer. You can repair any damage (given time and the appropriate tools and materials needed) to any object made from simple materials such as wood, up to Size 11.

Each Creativity roll you attempt restores 5 + 5d10 Durability to the target.</p></li></ol><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h3>Lore</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Lore offers the Character knowledge of the unseen Metapowered world that is shrouded in mystery.</strong> Lore is folklore, occult, mysticism, and knowledge of the peculiarities of Metanthropes and other more obscure beings. In addition to the fields of study, each Level at Lore provides the Character with the awareness of the existence of Metapowers and Combos beyond the ones they own, and the ability to identify them they encounter them.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Examples of fields of study:</strong> Folk Lore, Enigmas, Alien Species(taken separately for each species), Spirits (taken separately for each type Spirit, Anima, or Incarnation), Dimensions (taken separately for each Dimension), Meta Artifacts, Metatherions</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><ol start=\"0\"><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\">You are oblivious to the existence of other Metapowers beyond your own.

Experience is a game currency that is given to Players by the Narrator at the beginning of each new Session. Players gain Experience through their roleplay and the actions their Protagonists accomplish in-game. <strong>Protagonists start with a starting amount of Experience their Players can spent to develop them. Unless the Narrator states otherwise, that amount is 1000 Experience.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Some One-Shot Sessions or Sagas may offer different amount of Experience, according to the story and the severity of the adversity the Coalition is about to face. <strong>When it comes to rewarding further Experience, can only be done during Sagas, or One-Shot stories which extend to additional Sessions.</strong> Purely One-Shot experiences shall award no Experience, and there will be no further development of the Protagonists.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Experience as a resource is Player-bound and not Protagonist-bound.</strong> All Experience gathered and spent by a Player during a Saga for their current Protagonist can be transferred to that Player‚Äôs next Protagonist in case of an untimely death of a Protagonist or in case a Player wants to abandon their current Character and create a new one.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">For more about new Protagonists, see @UUID[.bjWMvlWDwsU319DF]{New Characters}</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">For more about a Protagonist's death, see @UUID[Compendium.metanthropes.welcome.JournalEntry.8tVVlGzZE4KriD12.JournalEntryPage.RJ71fneUufIAxRMZ#death]{Death}</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Awarding Experience</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The amount of Experience awarded to each Player by the Narrator at the beginning of each new Session is based on the performance of the Protagonists and the events their Protagonists experienced during the last Session. <strong>The categories on which upon awarding Experience are based are the following: Roleplay, Acting, Goals, Adversity, Discovery, Influence.</strong> Those criteria are explained in detail in the segment below. The Experience awarded increases with the passing of each Session played. The specific amount of Experience awarded is ultimately based at the Narrator‚Äôs discretion.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><ol><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplay:</strong> Roleplaying who your Protagonist is. Considering not only a Protagonist's general concept, Background, Metamorphosis, Arc and Regression but also the Character's ideologies, morals, code of conduct, childhood, ambitions, goals, fears, regrets, trauma, dreams, conscious and subconscious decisions and finally the in-game experiences that molded the Protagonist after the beginning of the story.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Acting:</strong> Embodying your Protagonist. Changing the voice, tone, way of standing, mannerisms, eccentricities, idiosyncrasies, quirks, and any intense and memorable performances. The more distinct is the line between in-game and out-of-game the more Experience is awarded.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Goals:</strong> Setting new goals and striving to succeed them. Laying detailed plans on how to archive them and working towards achieving them. There are personal goals for each Protagonist, and collective goals all members of a Coalition are striving towards. Setting serious goals is important, but ultimately more Experience is awarded when achieving them.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Adversity:</strong> Confronting and overcoming challenges. Facing and overcoming adversity in form of a Character's phobias or Antagonists, and dealing with daring and life-threating situations. Recklessness without reason, winning or surviving out of pure luck, masochistic and self-destructive behaviors should not be equally rewarded with facing true adversity.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Discovery:</strong> Exploring new landscapes and ideologies. Discovering more about the Cosmos and the world the Protagonist lives in, meeting new important Characters, encountering the use of new Metapowers, visiting new lands or new Dimensions, meeting new ideologies, learning new lore, disillusioning old lies, unraveling plots and demystifying the veil of the unknown.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Influence:</strong> Change the world, and the lives of the people who live in it. Influencing the world by changing mindsets of other Characters, overpowering old regimes, altering the reality and worldview of others, bringing down systems and raising new ones, inspiring revolutions, and synthesizing new philosophies, ideologies, and beliefs.</p></li></ol><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Spending Experience</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Experience can be spent to unlock new Metapowers and Perks, progress them to higher levels, and to advance Characteristics or Stats.</strong> Players can spend this Experience to progress their Protagonists before the first Scene of the new Session begins. Alternatively, Players can choose to store their Experience for later use. Narrators can progress their NPCs in a similar way that Protagonists do, or follow any other alternative method of progression.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h3>Progressing Characteristics</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Characters can progress their Characteristics by spending Experience. When progressing Characteristics, a Player is progressing their Protagonists base Characteristic. The base Characteristic is equal to their starting number of that Characteristic, plus any previous progressions by spending Experience. Base Characteristic do not include any increases from any type of Buffs, or decreases from any type of Conditions. <strong>The cost of progressing a Characteristic is equal to: The Characteristic‚Äôs base score * 10. Each progression increases the Characteristic by + 5%. A Character can progress the same Characteristic up to five times total.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Progressing Characteristics</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>My Soul is at 10% and I want to progress it.

When progressing Stats, a Player is progressing their Protagonists base Stat. The base Stat is equal to their starting number of that Characteristic (which includes the base from the Stat's Characteristic), plus any previous progressions by spending Experience. Base Stats do not include any increases from any type of Buffs, or decreases from any type of Conditions. <strong>The cost of progressing a Stat is equal to: The Stat‚Äôs current score * 3. Each progression increases the Stat by + 5%. A Character can advance the same Stat up to five times total.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Progressing Stats</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>My Perception is at 35% and I want to progress it.

Progressing Perks once the story has began requires in-game training time.</strong> Non-newly created Characters, without the aid of Metapowers, cannot learn new skills and knowledges overnight. Once the Saga has begun, Characters need to spend time in-game learning their new Perks in addition to spending Experience for them.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Progressing Perks</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>I want to unlock a new Perk for my newly created Protagonist. The Experience costs for unlocking that Perk is 100.

The experience costs of unlocking and progressing additional Metapowers beyond one's Prime Metapower differ according to the Classification and Energy Type of a Metanthrope‚Äôs Prime Metapower. <strong>Each Classification matches with two neighboring and synergizing Classifications.
