You can seamlessly blend with your surroundings, effectively becoming invisible as long as you remain still or move slowly without engaging in actions. However, this basic form of invisibility has its limitations. It typically lasts for several seconds, and it is relatively easy to detect, as it can be revealed by various forms of spectrum analysis, including cameras and lenses. Furthermore, this level of invisibility does not extend to making your clothing invisible, which can be a telltale sign to keen observers.</span></em></p>"

With Normalization, you can effortlessly re-establish the normal state of any abnormalities caused by the use of Metapowers in the environment or upon other individuals. An invisible aura surrounds you, constantly re-normalizing any alterations and reverting them back to their original form and shape. This remarkable effect can last for several minutes, and skilled Arbiters can even choose to exclude specific areas from the aura. However, attempting to use this power without sufficient control may result in backfiring, causing any positive changes you have made to yourself to be undone.</em></p>"

The most adept Clairvoyants can further extend the range and complexity of this insight, while mishaps during activation might lead to inner turmoil. The process of Pick The Brain becomes an intricate dance of perception, deciphering the essence of every individual encountered, empowering you with a comprehensive understanding of the myriad souls that cross your path.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

You hear the answers to any language you understand, allowing you to contact with any ancestor of the distant past. Yet, the answers are nuanced by the temporal scope of the past, and your inquiries must align with the annals of their lineage. Overindulgence in this communion might render the Utilitarian with fleeting whispers and fractured thoughts, akin to a mosaic of ancestral murmurs.</em></p>"

The resultant burst of flames, akin to a flamethrower's force, engulfs anything within its wide reach. Flammable materials unfortunate enough to fall in its path are consumed by the inferno for the following minute. Nimble manipulations of this fiery torrent can extend its range and intensify the blaze's ferocity. However, a misstep might lead to an unintended consequence as the flames recoil, dancing dangerously close to your own skin. Conversely, this level of mastery can be harnessed to douse existing flames within its sphere.</em></p>"

Flammable materials unfortunate enough to fall in its path are consumed by the inferno for the following minute. Nimble manipulations of this fiery torrent can extend its range and intensify the blaze's ferocity. However, a misstep might lead to an unintended consequence as the flames recoil, dancing dangerously close to your own skin. Conversely, this level of mastery can be harnessed to douse existing flames within its sphere.</em></p>"

This dynamic defense provides elemental resilience against other volatile forces while doubling as an offensive tool to engulf all in proximity. As you move, the searing flames follow your path, transforming anything they touch into smoldering embers. Yet, this technique carries its own risk, as a mistimed execution might transform you into the epicenter of your own inferno.</em></p>"

With an activation of Enlarge, you command your body to grow dramatically in size. This metamorphosis can magnify you to the stature of an elephant, endowing you with newfound reach, extraordinary striking force, and unparalleled durability. Your clothing accommodates this expansion, fitting your larger form, while the items you hold remain unaffected. The activation of Enlarge flows effortlessly, its effects lingering for a span of one to several minutes, dictated by your innate strength. However, a misstep during activation might temporarily wear you out, preventing you from activating any uses of this Metapower.</span></em></p>"

Activating Shorten, your body undergoes a remarkable transformation, contracting in size. While this initial alteration may seem modest, it serves as a foundational step toward the potential for more drastic shifts in size. This transformation brings about not only a change in height but also in mass, rendering you notably lighter. This newfound agility complements your stealth and covert movement, allowing you to slip through the environment unnoticed. Your attire adjusts accordingly, although objects in your grasp remain unaltered. The Shorten effect flows seamlessly and persists for a variable duration, anywhere from one to several minutes. A slightly overzealous activation may leave you tired, a gentle reminder of the newfound power within.</span></em></p>"

It heals you, saving you from mild medical conditions and granting you the ability to recover swiftly from minor injuries. Although its duration is short, lasting only a few seconds, skilled Aegises can harness their inner power to extend the effects of Refresh, allowing for a more prolonged period of healing and rejuvenation. The sensation of regeneration is warm and rejuvenating, akin to a gentle surge of life coursing through your veins, renewing and repairing your body with remarkable speed and efficiency.</em></p>"

Moreover, you can manipulate colors to the minutest detail, altering the visual perception of objects within the affected area. The duration and reach of these effects can be expanded with skill, but the risk of backfiring and causing temporary blindness remains a concern.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

Those transported through Photokinetic Movement are briefly enveloped in an intense bright light, akin to a fleeting glimpse of the sun, before being instantaneously transferred to the desired location.

Time Benders of extraordinary skill can extend the duration of this temporal pause, seizing upon the suspended moments to weave their plans and shape the destiny of the Coalition.

Within this domain, you gain the power to make your target repeat their last few seconds or skip the next crucial moments. As you activate this effect, it manifests as a visible glitch, akin to a surreal moment captured on video. Witnessing such temporal anomalies can unsettle both humans and animals alike. With Temporal Glitch, you hold the power to impede the bleeding of an open wound or accelerate its flow, manipulate the timing of a device such as an alarm or detonator, or orchestrate other subtle temporal manipulations. The adept Time Bender can enhance the effect by extending its reach, targeting additional entities, or even triggering cascading events in succession. However, a failed activation of Temporal Glitch may momentarily leave you disoriented, struggling to find your bearings in the tides of time.</em></p>"

Within this domain, you gain the power to make your target repeat their last few seconds or skip the next crucial moments. As you activate this effect, it manifests as a visible glitch, akin to a surreal moment captured on video. Witnessing such temporal anomalies can unsettle both humans and animals alike. With Temporal Glitch, you hold the power to impede the bleeding of an open wound or accelerate its flow, manipulate the timing of a device such as an alarm or detonator, or orchestrate other subtle temporal manipulations. The adept Time Bender can enhance the effect by extending its reach, targeting additional entities, or even triggering cascading events in succession. However, a failed activation of Temporal Glitch may momentarily leave you disoriented, struggling to find your bearings in the tides of time.</em></p>"

It is important to note that Temporal Warping requires the target's willingness, although at advanced levels, the Arbiter can impose their temporal will even on unwilling individuals, nullifying their defenses or prolonging their periods of turmoil.

You possess the choice to expand the duration of positive effects under your target's experience or alternatively shorten the time of their afflictions. It is important to note that Temporal Warping requires the target's willingness, although at advanced levels, the Arbiter can impose their temporal will even on unwilling individuals, nullifying their defenses or prolonging their periods of turmoil. Precise activations may amplify the effect of Temporal Warping, while careless attempts may cause a severe disorientation, momentarily jolting the Arbiter's temporal awareness.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

With keen attention, you can considerably extend the range of your zoom-in, allowing you to view much further away than is humanly possible. This enhanced vision allows you to be a sharp observer and gather crucial information from a distance. However, using Zoom-In comes with a slight risk of a mild disorientation and temporary blindness that lasts for a minute instead, as the intense focus strains your eyes.</em></p>"

Using Thermal Vision, you can see into the dark with ease and locate living organisms by following the heat emitted by their bodies. This heightened level of perception enables you to detect hidden dangers, track the movement of others, and gather crucial information even in low-light conditions. However, as with previous levels of this Metapower, the effects' duration can be extended, but it can also backlash, leaving you severely disoriented and temporarily blind for a minute instead, as the intense visual input overwhelms your senses.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

              "value": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>By using this level of Meta Vision, Microscope allows you to seamlessly detect smaller targets in the environment. You have no difficulty spotting something that could be considered harder to find due to its small size, and you can even narrow it down to targets smaller than specks of sand. This technique lasts from one to several minutes, depending on your ability to use your keen vision, but there is a small chance of it backfiring and turning you temporarily blind and disoriented for the next minute instead. This heightened level of Meta Vision allows you to become an exceptional observer and investigator, as you can notice even the tiniest details and gather information that might be overlooked by others.</em></p>"

            "content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Metanthropes RPG utilizes a d100 system. Each type of action attempted by a Player, or the Narrator, depends on a 100-sided die roll to determine its outcome. Two ten-sided dice are rolled simultaneously, one representing the double digits of the roll, and the other representing the single digits. Players compare the outcome of their rolls with the Stats of their Protagonist (<em>which are always in the form of a % percentage</em>) to determine whether their roll is a success or a failure. <strong>When attempting a d100 roll, you are successful when you have rolled the number of your Stat used and below.</strong> Whenever your result is above your Stat used, then the roll is considered a failure.</p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>How a d100 roll works</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>The Narrator asks me to make a roll on the behalf of my Protagonist. My required Stat score is 50% and my dice result was 50. I barely made it, but it was a successful attempt. In case I would have rolled 51 and above, my result would have been a failure.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Ten-sided dice (single digits only) are rolled to determine other numerical outcomes, such as the Duration of an activated effect, the total Damage inflicted by a source and others. <strong>When a roll of 10 occurs, the 10 counts towards the outcome of the roll; the die is then re-rolled, and the new outcome is added to the total.</strong> This process is repeated for each result of 10, any number of times, before the final sum of the roll can be determined. This effect is called the “Splash 10” effect.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>How a d10 roll works</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A roll which includes 2d10 (two ten-sided dice) is asked of my Protagonist, to determine the total number of Targets of an effect. My roll’s result was 2 and 10, the Splash 10 Effect commences and the 10 is added to the total and then re-rolled. The second result was another 10, so the process repeats, and the third result was a 3. My total result of that roll was 25 (2 + 10 + 10 + 3).</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Whenever any numerical values need to be multiplied or divided, resulting in decimals, the result is always rounded up.</strong></p><p></p>",

            "content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">A Metanthropes Session consists of Scenes, where Protagonists and NPCs interact through dialogue and individual actions to shape the story. Such Scenes are not turn-based, and Characters can interact in real-time as actors in a play. However, whenever any number of Characters involved in a Scene want to perform opposing or contradicting actions, with different interests and conflicting purposes, then a turn-based Action Scene commences. <strong>During an Action Scene, in-game time comes to a halt, and Character actions become subject to a specific set of rules presented in this section.</strong> Always consider an Action Scene as part of the current ongoing Scene.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Initiative</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">During an Action Scene, Characters act in Turns. The order by which each Character may act is determined by an Initiative roll. <strong>Initiative is what sets the play order for all Characters involved in an Action Scene.</strong> When the Narrator calls for Initiative, all Characters involved in the Action Scene proceed to make a Reflexes roll. The Character with the most accumulated <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> will play first, followed by the one with the second most <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i>, up until the Character with the least <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> has played. Then the Character with the least <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-xmark\"></i> will play, followed by the one with the second least <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-xmark\"></i> , up until the Character with the most <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-xmark\"></i> has played as well. In case of a Critical Success or a Critical Failure, the Character who made the roll is awarded a Destiny as usual during such rolls and accumulates 10 <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> in case of a Critical Success or 10 <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-xmark\"></i> in case of a Critical Failure. There is no additional reward or punishment at Critical Rolls during Initiative.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>In case multiple Characters enter the Initiative with the same outcome, whoever has the highest Reflexes plays first, followed by the one with the second highest and so on.</strong> In case any Characters who have the same Initiative outcome, and both have the exact same number as their Stat which was involved at rolling Initiative: then both Characters receive a Destiny and make an additional Initiative roll to determine who goes first between them. Some Characters who might have Metapowers such as 6th Sense, might roll Initiative with a different Stat, other than Reflexes.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Example of Initiative</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Four Characters (A, B, C, D) are involved in an Action Scene, and roll for Initiative. Their result are <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> for Character A, <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> for Character B, and <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-xmark\"></i> for both Character C and D. Characters C and D both had the same result, but Character D has a higher Reflexes score. The final order of play is the following: Character B, Character A, Character D, and Character C.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Turn</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>A Turn begins whenever it is a Character’s turn to play during an Action Scene.</strong> A Turn’s duration in-game is usually a few seconds unless the Narrator states otherwise. Read below the segment “During my Turn” for more about what can be accomplished during a Turn.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Round</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>When all Characters involved in the Action Scene complete their Turn, a Round is complete.</strong> A full Action Scene Round lasts up to thirty seconds, although the in-game time of each Round is largely dependent on the nature of the actions undertaken by the Characters and the situation in-game.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Cycle</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>A Cycle consists of two consecutive Rounds within an Action Scene.</strong> Following the end of the first Round, all Characters involved in the Action Scene play again, using the same Initiative score. After the second Round is completed, the first Cycle of the Action Scene ends. After each Cycle ends, each Character involved in the Action Scenes proceeds to make a subsequent Reflexes roll to determine the next Cycle’s Initiative order. When the next Cycle is over, repeat the process until the Narrator declares the Action Scene is over.</p><p></p><h3>Ambush Round</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the case that one Character, or a group of Characters, engage in an Action Scene involving a Character or a group of Characters that are completely unaware of, or unalerted to, the initiators of the Action Scene, then an Ambush Round is played. <strong>During an Ambush Round, only the initiators and those who are aware of the ambush may roll Reflexes for Initiative.</strong> Ambushed Characters do not roll Initiative during this Round but are still able to use their Reaction (read below for more about Reactions).</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Once all the Characters in the Initiative have finished their Turn, the Ambush Round ends. Then, a new Initiative roll must be performed by all Characters involved, beginning with the first full Cycle of the Action Scene.</strong> An Ambush Round occurs only when at least one Character is unaware and caught by surprise when the Action Scene starts.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>During My Turn</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>During a Turn, a Character can Roleplay, perform a Movement (move my Character around, and interact with the environment), and attempt Actions (anything which involves dice rolling).</strong> Roleplaying during my Turn during an Action Scene is different than Roleplaying during any other Scene; it should not be extensive or highly elaborate, as there is less time to engage in dialogue while performing other actions and moving around. Players are encouraged to allow for minimal “free Roleplay” during their Turns, limited to a few lines when it is my Turn, and only a couple outside of my Turn, within the Round. However, in the event I want my Protagonist to engage in more extensive Roleplay during my Scene, I can choose to forgo doing Actions, or Movement, or even my whole Turn, at the Narrator’s discretion.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><img src=\"systems/metanthropes/assets/artwork/journals/during-my-turn.webp\" class=\"centered\" /><p></p><h3>Wait</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>In the case that a Character is not ready to play their Turn right away, but they do not want to lose their involvement in the Round, they can choose to Wait</strong>. By doing so, they temporarily forgo performing Actions and Movement, and the next Character in the Initiative order plays. After that Character, the Character who has chosen to Wait can declare to the Narrator that they want their Wait to end and join in and play their Turn. When choosing the option of Wait, a Character cannot perform any type of Action (except for their Reaction, see below for more about Reactions), nor any Movement, and they are only limited to a few lines of \"free Roleplay\".</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p>"

            "content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Action in Metanthropes is anything that involves making a d100 roll (and sometimes subsequently d10 rolls as well). <strong>During each of my Turns, I have access to three different slots of Actions. A Main Action, an Extra Action, and a Reaction.</strong> Whatever a Character mainly attempts during a Turn, spends the Main Action slot. A Character's Extra Action slot can be spent on undemanding, simple tasks. The Reaction slot is reserved as an answer to other Characters’ actions. A Reaction is the only type of Action that can be played during another Character’s Turn.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Additionally, an activity that requires a Character's absolute focus and additional time to be activated, might turn into a Focused Action. <strong>A Focused Action requires spending all Action slots and a Character's Movement in order to commence.</strong> The exact time a Focused Action might require completing varies, according to the task at hand, from a Full-Turn, to a Cycle, or more.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>At the beginning of each new Round, all Characters refresh all their Action slots.</strong> Lastly, the Narrator can offer a Character any number of Free Rolls that do not take any of the mentioned slots in order for the Character to perform minor feats not worthy of an Action slot. One such roll is always the defending Character’s roll in case of a VS roll. Unless specifically stated, the Narrator has the final say as to which Character’s Action should take the Main Action, Extra Action, Focused Action, or Reaction slot, or if they should take no slot at all and be offered a Free Roll instead.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Main Action</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>A Main Action can be any type of action which requires a successful dice roll, but also sufficient time and concentration to perform.</strong> A Main Action requires some concentration, but not the entire focus of a Character, enabling them to move and potentially do additional things while still performing the Main Action. Most Stat rolls, Metapowered activations, uses of Possessions, and most types of Attacks require spending the Main Action slot. The Main Action slot can be turned to a Multi-Action, whenever a Character wants to attempt multiple Main Actions during a single Turn by reducing the efficiency of each roll.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h3>Multi-Action</h3><h4></h4><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Characters may choose to split their Main Action into multiple Main Actions, called a Multi-Action.</strong> A Character can perform the same Main Action multiple times or attempt different Main Actions with a successful Multi-Action. Only a Main Action slot can be turned into Multi-Action, not any other type of Action slots.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Whenever a Character is attempting a Multi-Action, apply a – 10% Reduction on all Main Action rolls attempted by that Character this Turn, for each number of total Main Actions attempted.</strong> There is no limit to the number of additional Main Actions a Character can include as part of a Multi-Action, but in the event any of the Stat rolls involved drops below 1% due to the Multi-Action reduction, then that Character cannot perform that Multi-Action.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>How Multi-Action Reductions function</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Attempting two Main Actions as part of a Multi-Action, will impose a by – 20% Reduction to both rolls. Attempting a Multi-Action with three Main Actions will impose a – 30% Reduction to all three rolls. Attempting a Multi-Action with four Main Actions will impose a – 40% Reduction on all four rolls, and so on.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>The reduction imposed by the Multi-Action is not considered a Penalty.</strong> Attempting a Multi-Action while having a Penalty on any of the rolls attempted, will cause the total reduction of the roll to stack, and additionally reduce the Character’s chance of success.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>How Penalties and Reduction from Multi-Action stack</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A Character attempts a Multi-Action which includes two Main Actions and the second of those rolls has a – 20% Penalty, then that Character will attempt the two rolls, the first with a – 20% Reduction and the other with a total – 40% reduction (- 20% due to Multi-Action and another – 20% due to the Penalty).</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>A Character attempting a Multi-Action must state the total number of Main Actions to be included in the Multi-Action before attempting any of the rolls.</strong> A Character cannot add or remove any number of Main Actions after they have attempted the first. A Character must only state the total number of Actions, allowing to change, or repeat the same Main Actions in case of failing any of them. A Character can choose to forgo attempting any of the number of Main Actions declared to be attempted and choose different Targets from those originally intended. In the event a Character wants to spend Destiny (<i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> ) to reroll any of the rolls involved in a Multi-Action, they can do so for each roll individually.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Extra Action</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>An Extra Action is a supportive roll to whichever secondary activity a Character wishes to commence during a Turn.</strong> The Extra Action slot allows the Character to perform activities that do not require much concentration or attention. The Extra Action can be attempted before or after a Character has attempted their Main Action during a Turn.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Additionally, a Character can always spend their Extra Action to de-activate any previously activated Metapower effect with ongoing Duration.</strong> A Character can also use the Extra Action slot to willingly reduce any number of <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> ️ from a d100 roll they make or remove any number of d10 dice results from a d10 Roll, in the event a Character wants to deliberately mitigate the efficiency of the effort. In order to do so, a Character can spend their Extra Action before attempting any other Action that the Character wishes to mitigate the efficiency preemptively. Alternatively, it can be done so after the other Action's has been attempted, before its result takes place, provided that the Character has the Extra Action slot available.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Reaction</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The Reaction slot is the only type of Action that can be attempted outside of a Character’s Turn in the Initiative order. <strong>Characters can spend their Reaction at any time during a Round in response to any Character’s Actions or Movement.</strong> The Reaction can take place before or after the Action of the other Character concludes or at any time during their Movement. A Character can spend their Reaction in response to their Action or Movement attempted by the same Character. In the event multiple Characters want to perform their Reaction during another Character’s Turn, then the Character with the best Initiative score attempts their Reaction first, followed by the one who has the second best, and so on. A Character cannot attempt a Reaction which requires spending any other Action slot, unless stated otherwise by the attempted roll’s description or by the Narrator.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>A Character can spend their Reaction to Evade incoming Strikes from other Character who have entered their space, and threaten them with close-range attacks.</strong> During perilous situations, a Character can spend their Reaction dive for Cover, or get in front of another adjacent Character to save them from an upcoming danger.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Focused Action</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Attempting an Action which requires extra attention, full concentration, or additional time to be activated, requires performing a Focused Action. Focused Actions have activations which require an entire Turn, or possibly even more in-game time. <strong>Attempting a Focused Action requires a Character to forgo their Movement, their Main Action, and Extra Action slots, and even their Reaction slot, throughout the entire time the Focused Action is activated.</strong> In case a Character has already spent their Reaction during this Round, they cannot commit to a Focused Action. In case a Character spends their Reaction while in the middle of performing a Focused Action, then the Focused Action is cancelled.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Focused Action activation time vary from a Full-Turn, a Cycle (in which case you will lose your Movement, Extra Action, and Reaction twice) or more. The Focused Action’s result commences at the end of the Focused Action’s activation, and only in the event the Character attempting it has not activated any other Action or Movement during that time. <strong>A Character can decide to stop their attempt at Focused Action, losing their progress in return, in the event they decide to attempt any other Actions instead (such as spend Reaction while performing a Focused Action).</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Free Rolls</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Free Rolls are additional rolls deemed unfit to take any Action slots during a Turn.</strong> With the Narrator’s approval, Free Rolls can be attempted even out of turn. There is no limit to how many Free Rolls a Character can attempt during a Round, but the Narrator ultimately decides which rolls can be categorized as Free Rolls.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p>"

The amount of <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> accumulated, determines the total number of the Weight of the target that can be handled this way, as seen in the following table. The symbol ⬢ represents one Hexagon. Targets below Weight 10 apply a Bonus when attempting to lift, push, or pull them. Tossing, pushing, or pulling targets below Weight 9 moves them more than one ⬢ Hexagon per <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> accumulated. Targets of Weight 10 and above might require multiple <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> accumulated to be lifted or moved one ⬢ Hexagon.</p><p></p><img src=\"systems/metanthropes/assets/artwork/tables/power.webp\" class=\"centered\" /><p></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>My Protagonist attempts to push a container with Weight 13, and I manage to accumulate <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i>, a valiant effort, but the container will not move.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>My Protagonist attempts to lift a small log with Weight 9, my roll will gain a +10% Bonus due to its smaller Size and I manage to accumulate <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i>, therefore I lift the log with ease.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>My Protagonist attempts to toss an object with Weight 6 as far as I can.

            "content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Combat is a part of an Action Scene which includes any kind of attacks, rolling for Damage, loss of Life and any other life-threating situations.</strong> Combat in Metanthropes involves Characters getting hurt, injured, or even dying.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>💓 Life</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Life in Metanthropes represents a Character’s overall health, vitality, and will to live. Metanthrope Characters have a Life total of (100 + their Endurance score).</strong> Humans have a Life total of (50 + their Endurance score). Other Antagonist type Life totals may vary according to their specifics. Injuries of any kind reduce the Life total. Whenever a Character reaches 0 or less Life, that Character dies. The Life of Objects is called Durability.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>💞 Healing</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Healing increases a Character’s current Life.</strong> A Character’s Life total cannot be exceeded with excessive Healing. Some Metapowers offer access to direct and effective Healing, although nature works at a much slower rate. To provide proper medical attention, a Character might need a medical kit containing bandages and so on, (depending on the Condition and the trauma) and the Perk: Medicine at a level according to the wound’s complexity.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-burst\"></i> Damage</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>A Character’s Life is reduced by Damage. Damage is calculated by a total number of d10 dice rolled, plus any base number of Damage.</strong> Damage is caused by any harmful source, from an event like getting punched, to being ravaged by otherworldly forces. There are four Energy Types in Metanthropes: Cosmic, Elemental, Material, and Psychic. Each Energy Type causes its own type of Damage. Damage caused by Psychic energies is in the form of Psychic Damage and so on.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p><h2><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-shield-halved\"></i> Buffs</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Buffs are positive effects received from effects such as Metapowers.</strong> Buffs are categorized as Buffs that increase the Characteristics or Stats of a Character, and Other Buffs which apply other type of positive effects. Buffs which increase the Characteristics or Stats of a Character are sub-categorized into Buffs of the Body, the Mind, the Soul.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Buffs of the Body include the Buffs:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Fortified (Endurance)</strong>,</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Empowered (Power)</strong>,</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Hastened (Reflexes)</strong> and</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Hardened (Body)</strong>.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Buffs of the Mind include the Buffs:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Inspired (Creativity)</strong>,</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Articulated (Manipulation)</strong>,</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Alerted (Perception)</strong> and</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Sharpened (Mind)</strong>.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Buffs of the Soul include the Buffs:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Focused (Awareness)</strong>,</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Awakened (Consciousness)</strong>,</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Determined (Willpower)</strong> and</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Enlightened (Soul)</strong>.</p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Buffs increase their respective Characteristic or Stat by + 5% per level.</strong> Buffs which increase a Characteristic, as a result increase all the Stats tied to that Characteristic. A Character’s Stat can be increased both by the Buff of that Stat and of its respective Characteristic.</p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>How Buffs of the Characteristic and Stat can stack</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A Character with a base score of Manipulation of 35% who is later being applied the Buffs: Articulated 3 (Manipulation + 15%) and Sharpened 3 (Mind +15%) will have a total Manipulation score of (35% +15% +15%) = 65%.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Multiple Buffs of the same name do not stack, and only the one with the highest numerical value is considered, the rest are ignored.</strong> Receiving the same Buff again simply refreshes the effect's Duration.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>How multiple Buffs which increase the same Stat do not stack</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A Character has received the Buffs: Empowered 2 (Power + 10%) Empowered 5 (Power +25%) and Empowered 1 (Power +5%). Only the highest Buff is considered, therefore that Character is affected only by the Buff: Empowered 5.</em></p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The Other Buffs include the categories: Cover, Detection, Environment, Enhance Movement, Immunity, and Resistance. <strong>Buffs which have no numerical value, but rather are followed by a specific subcategory can stack with each other, even if they have the same name.</strong> One exception to this rule is the category of Buff: Shift. Only one Shift (the one with the highest level) can be active simultaneously. Read below for more about Shifts.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>How multiple Buffs with different names can stack</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A Character can be affected by the following Buffs simultaneously: Immunity (Slowed), Immunity (Skin Injury), Detection (Invisibility), and Detection (Darkness).</em></p><p></p><h3>Cover</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Cover offers a Character a chance for incoming attacks to hit the Cover (ignoring all Damage and Conditions) instead of the Character. Each Energy Type has its own Cover.</strong> There are four types of Covers, one for each of the Energy Types (Cosmic, Elemental, Material, Psychic), each corresponding to their appropriate Damage type, and/or Conditions. A Character can roll for Cover against any effect that applies Damage of the Energy Type of the Cover type they have. Rolling for Cover is a Random roll and offers no Destiny (<i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i>) at any Critical roll outcomes. The roll for Cover comes first, before the attempted targeted effect's roll. Cover rolls are not subjected to Bonuses or Penalties. The Character who has the Cover rolls for it.</p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Cover ranges from a 10% chance to a 90% chance. Much like when determining the success of a d100 roll, an attack hits the Cover instead of the target when the roll's outcome is equal to or less than the Cover's score. Cover is effective against targeted attacks and effects, but also against area-of-effect type of attacks. <strong>Cover can be attained by Metapowers and Possessions, but also by natural finding cover in the surrounding environment.</strong> For more about Cover in the environment, read the following segment: Aiming.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>How multiple Covers to multiple Energy Types function</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A Character has received the Buffs: Cover 50% against Material and Elemental Energy Types and Cover 75% only against Material Energy Types. Only the highest Buff for each Energy Type is considered, therefore that Character's is affected only by the Buff: Cover 75% against Material Energy Types, and 50% for Elemental Energy Types.</em></p><p></p><h3>Detection</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Detections allow a Character to perceive something others cannot.</strong> When activating a Buff: Detection, a Character adds a specific type of Character, Object, Dimension, Buff, or Condition to their sensory range. A Character can have any number of different Detections activated at the same time.</p><p></p><h3>Movement Enhancing</h3><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Movement Enhancing Buffs offer better Movement through increasing the Speed (Accelerated), increasing the Size (Enlarged), or decreasing the Weight (Lightened).</strong> Each of these Buffs increase their appropriate category by +1 up to level 5 such Buffs which increase by + 5. Same as with other Buffs, multiple Movement Enhancing Buffs of the same name do not stack, and only the one with the highest numerical value is considered. Read in the section of Movement for more about how these Buffs influence the Movement.</p><p></p><h3>Immunity</h3><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Immunity offers immunity, ignoring the side effects of Conditions, Damage, or specific effects.</strong> When Immunity is activated, it removes any Conditions of the same name, or level equal to or less than the number following the Immunity activated. A Character can have any number of different Immunities activated at the same time. In case a Character is affected by a Condition, and then receives Immunity to that Condition, that Condition is automatically removed.</p><p></p><h3>Resistance</h3><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Resistance in Metanthropes represents a shield that absorbs part or all of the Damage. <strong>Resistance is a static number that reduces the total amount of Damage dealt. There are four types of Resistances, one for each of the Energy Types (Cosmic, Elemental, Material, Psychic), each corresponding to their appropriate Damage type.</strong> After rolling for Damage, remove the appropriate Resistance number from the total Damage. Any remaining Damage is the only Damage the Character receives. Multiple Resistances to the same Energy Type do not stack, similarly to Bonuses – calculate only the highest amongst them. A Character can have multiple Resistances, and only the highest among them for each Energy Type is considered.</p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>How Damage and Resistance function</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A Character attacks with a firearm which deals 4d10 + 40 Material Damage another Character who has 30 Material Resistance. The result of the 4d10 equals 35. To that result is added the base 40 Damage of the Weapon. The total Damage is 75. The Target subtracts 30 due to their Material Resistance, and the final Damage received is 45.</em></p><p></p><h3>Shift</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Shifts are Buffs which alter the physiology, biomass, shape, and form of the one who activates them. This type of Buff does not allow multiple such alterations in one’s body to function simultaneously.</strong> Multiple Shifts activated at the same target do not stack, and only the one with the highest numerical value is considered. In case two Shifts of the same level are active at the same target, the target chooses which one to apply.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>How multiple Buffs: Shift do not stack</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A Character has received the Buffs Shift: Shapeshift 2, Sizeshift 3, and Aero Form. Since Aero Form is offered by a level 5 Metapower, it is a level 5 Shift, and therefore only the Shift: Aero Form is considered.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-skull\"></i> Conditions</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Conditions, short for medical conditions, are negative effects received from injuries and trauma, physical or otherwise, inflicted by Metapowers, Combos, Possessions, or any type of attacks.</strong> Conditions are categorized as Conditions that decrease the Characteristics or Stats of a Character, and Other Conditions which apply other type of negative effects. Conditions which decrease the Characteristics and Stats are sub-categorized into Conditions of the Body, the Mind, the Soul.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Conditions of the Body include the Conditions:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Bone Injury (Endurance)</strong>,</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Muscle Injury (Power)</strong>,</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Skin Injury (Reflexes)</strong> and</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Burned (Body)</strong>.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Conditions of the Body further include Asphyxiation, Bleeding, Diseased and Maimed, which are going to be described below.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Conditions of the Mind include the Conditions:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Wobbly (Creativity)</strong>,</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Confused (Manipulation)</strong>,</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Disoriented (Perception)</strong> and</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Disconnected (Mind)</strong>.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Conditions of the Mind include Pain, Fatigue, Hunger, and Sense Lost, which are going to be described below.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Conditions of the Soul include the Conditions:</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Bewildered (Awareness)</strong>,</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Demented (Consciousness)</strong>,</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Terrorized (Willpower)</strong> and</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Tormented (Soul)</strong>.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Conditions of the Soul further include Amnesia, Probed, Infiltrated, and Unconscious, which are going to be described below.</p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Conditions decrease their respective Characteristic or Stat by - 5% per level. </strong>Multiple Conditions of the same name do not stack, and only the one with the highest numerical value is considered. Other than that, Conditions follow the exact same rules as mentioned above in Buffs.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h3>Asphyxiation</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>A Character who cannot breathe oxygen is asphyxiating. At the end of each Round, each asphyxiating Character must make an Endurance roll (Free Roll), and failure applies further Conditions, and Damage, depending on the level of Asphyxiation.</strong></p><p></p><h3>Bleeding</h3><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>At the end of each Round, a Character who has the Condition: Bleeding loses 1 Life per level of the Bleeding Condition.</strong></p><p></p><h3>Diseased</h3><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>A Character who has the Condition: Diseased receives a – 10% Penalty, per level of the Diseased Condition to all rolls attempted.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h3>Maimed</h3><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>A Character who receives the Condition: Maimed, depending on the level, and the location of the Condition, receives </strong><a href=\"https://www.metanthropes.com/conditions/body/maimed/\" title=\"Requires Narrator Access on Metanthropes.com\"><strong>further Conditions</strong></a><strong> and Penalties.</strong> A Character can be a victim of multiple different Maimed Conditions of any level, at each location of their body. The Condition: Maimed applies permanent damage, scars, disfigurements, or mutilations.</p><p></p><h3>Fatigue</h3><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>A Character who receives the Condition: Fatigue loses access to Actions and/or Movement depending on the level of the Condition.</strong></p><p></p><h3>Hunger</h3><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Hunger applies a Character a chance for any attempted Actions to fail. Rolling for Hunger is a Random roll and offers no Destiny (<i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i>) at any Critical roll outcomes. The roll for Hunger comes first, before the attempted roll. Hunger rolls are not subjected to Bonuses or Penalties. Hunger rolls do not apply to Initiative rolls, nor to any Random rolls, such as rolling for Cover.</strong> Hunger ranges from a 10% chance to a 90% chance. Much like when determining the success of a d100 roll, an Action fails due to Hunger when the roll's outcome is equal to or less than the Hunger’s score. A Character who has the Condition: Hunger and is attempting a Multi-Action, must make a Hunger roll for each number of Actions attempted.</p><p></p><h3>Pain</h3><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>A Character who receives the Condition: Pain subtracts a <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> per level of the Condition: Pain from all their successful rolls.</strong> A Character with any level of the Condition: Pain which attempts a roll and the roll’s outcome is a <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-square\"></i> then it turns into a <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-square-xmark\"></i>, no matter the level of the Condition: Pain. In case the outcome is a <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-square-xmark\"></i> or results in any amount of <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-xmark\"></i> - then the outcome remains the same.</p><p></p><h3>Sense Lost</h3><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>A Character who receives the Condition: Sense Lost cannot use the missing sense or attempt any roll which has a prerequisite <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-crosshairs-simple\"></i> of the sense they lost.</strong></p><p></p><h3>Probed</h3><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>A Character with the Condition: Probed is a victim of someone attempting to read their thoughts, track their location, or receive any information about them against their will. A Character can be under the effect of multiple Probed effects at the same time.</strong></p><p></p><h3>Infiltrated</h3><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>A Character with the Condition: Infiltrated is a victim of someone attempting to influence their emotion, thoughts, or gain control over their actions and movement. A Character cannot be under the effect of multiple Infiltrated effect at the same time, only the highest level among them is considered. In case of multiple of the same level, only the latest applied is being considered.</strong></p><p></p><h3>Unconscious</h3><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>A Character with the Condition: Unconscious is losing their consciousness and is passing out. At the end of each Round, each unconscious Character attempting to wake up, must make an Endurance roll (Free Roll) and if successful, they wake up.</strong> A Character who is sleeping or has passed out, cannot attempt any Actions or Movement, and neither is aware of their surroundings.</p><p></p><h3>Hinder Movement</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Hinder Movement Conditions affect Movement through decreasing the Speed (Slowed), decreasing the Size (Shrunken), or increasing the Weight (Encumbered).</strong> Each of these Conditions decrease their appropriate category by -1 up to level 5 such Conditions which decrease by - 5. Same as with other Conditions, multiple Hinder Movement Conditions of the same name do not stack, and only the one with the highest numerical value is considered. Read in Movement more about how these Conditions influence the Movement.</p><p></p><h3>Knocked Down &amp; Immobilized</h3><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>A Character which is Knocked Down requires to spend 5 of their total Movement to get back up. An Immobilized Character cannot spend any of their Movement to move around in the Grid, use Possessions or interact with the environment.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p><h2>Attacks</h2><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Attacks in Metanthropes are categorized into Strikes, and attacks with Melee or Ranged Weapons.</strong> Attacks apply Damage and Conditions according to their type. <span class=\"cf0\">An attack can be made by Aiming, or by using a Random roll which lands on a random point on the target</span>. If the attack is not done with Aiming, then the Narrator rolls a Random d100 roll to determine where the attack lands on the target’s body, as seen in the following table. Rolling for a random location is a Random roll and offers no Destiny (<i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i>) at any Critical roll outcomes.</p><p></p><p>Random Hit Location: @UUID[Compendium.metanthropes.rolltables.RollTable.z4Yf0BLg957bRJ07]{Humanoid Hit Location} Rollable Table.</p><p></p><img src=\"systems/metanthropes/assets/artwork/tables/aiming-random-roll.webp\" class=\" centered\" /><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h3>Aiming</h3><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Aiming in Metanthropes refers to attacks or effect which are targeting a particular location on a body or an object. Each location has its own roll Reduction, as seen in the following table. <strong>An aimed attack must be declared as such before the roll is made. Aiming offers a Reduction to a roll, which is not considered a Penalty, and therefore stacks with any additional Reductions from Multi-Actions and with Penalties.</strong></p><p></p><img src=\"systems/metanthropes/assets/artwork/tables/aiming-location.webp\" class=\" centered\" /><p></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Complex attack with Aiming, Multi-Action, and Penalty</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A Character attempts to Attack against another Character while under the effect of a - 20% Penalty. The Character declares that wants to attempt a Multi-Action of two Attacks, with the second one Aiming at the target's head. The first attack will be attempted with a total of -40% reduction (-20% Penalty, and -20% Reduction due to Multi-Action). The second attack will be attempted with a total of - 65% reduction (-20% Penalty, -20% Reduction due to Multi-Action, and a further - 25% Reduction due to Aiming at the head.</em></p><p></p><h3>Strike ️</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Strike in Metanthropes represents a Character’s physical attack made with bare hands, legs, knees, elbows, headbutts or via a Melee Weapon. The Strike’s unarmed Damage is of the Material Energy Type, and it deals 1d10 + the Character’s Power Score. A Strike requires spending the Main Action slot and is attempted with a Power roll.</strong> Since the Strike spends the slot of the Main Action, it can be turned into a Multi-Action. Strikes turned Multi-Action in-game translate into a choreography of attacks. A Strike turned into Multi-Action has the Damage of each successfully delivered Strike reduced by the amount of the Multi-Action’s reduction.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>In addition to the Strike’s Damage, according to the accumulated <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> ️ of the attack, successful Strikes also apply Conditions to their target.</strong> More accumulated <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> ️ translate in-game into Strikes delivered with accuracy and precision, and therefore apply more threating Conditions, as seen in the table below.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><img src=\"systems/metanthropes/assets/artwork/tables/accumulated-unarmed-strike.webp\" class=\" centered\" /><p></p><h3>Evade</h3><p>​</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Evade is the answer all Characters have against Strikes of any kind. Only Strikes can be evaded, not any type of attack from Projectile, or Firearm Weapons. Evade costs spending the Reaction slot, and attempting a Reflexes roll. One Evade Reaction may offer protection against multiple assailants.</strong> In case the evading Character is successful with their Evade attempt, then one <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> is removed from each of every attackers Strikes against the evading Character attempted this Round. In case any attacker was successful (<i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-square\"></i>) without accumulating any <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i>, then the attacks are also successfully evaded. For every additional <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> is accumulated by the evading Character, an additional <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> is removed from all the attackers' Strikes against the evading Character attempted this Round. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Evade against multiple Strikes example</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>An attacking Character attempts a Multi-Action with three total attacks against a defending Character. The defending Character attempts an Evade, and accumulates <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> The three Strikes of the attacking Character accumulate the following results: <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> for the first Strike, <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-square\"></i> for the second, and  <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> for the third. The defending Character's Evade makes the first two Strikes to miss completely, while removes  <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> from the attacker's third Strike. As a result, the attacker manages to hit the defending Character only once, accumulating a single <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> .</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em> </em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Evade against multiple attackers example</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>An attacking Character Characters attempts a single Strike against a defending Character. The defending Character attempts an Evade, and accumulates <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> The attacker accumulates the following result:  <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i>  . As a result, the attack is fully evaded. Later than Round another attacker attempts a single Strike against the same defending Character, and accumulates <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-square\"></i>. Since the result of the initial Evade remains the same for the entire Round, this attack is also fully evaded.</em></p><p>​</p><h3>Grappling</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Grapple attempts are Strikes which, if successful, have the result of immobilizing the target, instead of dealing Damage. A Character who is under the effect of a Grapple receives the Condition: Immobilized, and cannot perform any Movement.</strong> A Character must declare their intent to attempt a Grapple before making any rolls. To perform a successful Grapple, a Character must attempt a Power roll, and spend their Main Action slot while being within Range, similarly to any Strike. This roll can be part of a Multi-Action and it can be evaded by the target. If the Grapple is successful, both parties proceed into making a Free Roll (does not spend any further Action slot) which is a Power (of the initiator) VS the Power or the Reflexes (of the target), chosen between them by the target. In case the second Power roll is successful, the target cannot spend any of their Movement during their Turn.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>At the beginning of each of the Turns of a Character being grappled, that Character may now use their Extra Action slot to attempt to escape the grapple.</strong> Then they proceed on attempting a Power or Reflexes roll (chosen by the grappled Character) VS a Power roll of the initiator of the Grapple. In case the grappled target is successful at this roll, the target escapes the grapple.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h4>Specific Strikes</h4><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Specific Strikes may have different outcomes in addition, or instead of Damaging the target, such as disarming, tripping, feinting, pushing and more. In addition, Specific Strikes include complex grappling techniques such as body locks and other similar techniques. A Character must declare their intent to attempt a Specific Strike, and specify which one, before making any rolls. <strong>Although a Character is free to attempt Specific Strikes without being proficient with them by having the Perk: Athletics at the appropriate level, it will trigger a Penalty, depending on the technique attempted.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><img src=\"systems/metanthropes/assets/artwork/tables/perks-athletics.webp\" class=\" centered\" /><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h3>Melee Weapons</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Melee Weapons in Metanthropes refer to any weapons used in hand-to-hand combat, such as swords, spears, etc. Using Melee Weapons is considered a Strike, and it can be subjected to Evade, similarly to any other Strike. Melee Weapons increase the Damage dealt in comparison to an attack made unarmed. <strong>The Melee Weapon Strike Damage equal to (the Weapon base + dice Damage) + the Character's Power score. Although a Character is free to attempt to use Melee Weapons without having the appropriate Perk to use them, untrained attackers receive a Penalty according to the type of Melee Weapon used.</strong></p><p></p><img src=\"systems/metanthropes/assets/artwork/tables/accumulated-bladed-weapon.webp\" class=\" centered\" /><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h3>Ranged Weapons</h3><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Attacks made with Weapons from a distance are called Ranged Weapon attacks. Ranged Weapons are categorized into Projectile, and Firearm Weapons. Using Projectile, or Firearm Weapons without the appropriate Perk: Weapon level will result in rolling with a Penalty according to the complexity of the Projectile Weapon used.</strong> Projectiles thrown (like a rock) require a Power Roll while projectiles hurled (like a bow) require a Reflexes roll. Their Range is determined based on how far a Character can throw an object. They deal Damage equal to the Weapon’s Damage plus half your Power Stat (always rounded up). Firearms require a Perception Roll and deal Damage according to the Weapon’s Damage.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><img src=\"systems/metanthropes/assets/artwork/tables/accumulated-light-ammo.webp\" class=\" centered\" /><p></p><h2>Death</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Whenever a Character’s Life reaches 0 or below, that Character dies.</strong> When a Character dies, all active effects, and active Durations of Metapowers they have activated, or were activated to them, end.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>In case a Protagonist dies, the Player owning the Protagonist can choose to spend one Destiny (<i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i>) per Sessions they have played with that Protagonist, to save them from dying.</strong> Doing so will return the Protagonist to 1 Life instead of dying. In case the Player does not have enough Destiny, or chooses not to spend them, the Protagonist dies.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p>"

Energy Type dictates the Damage, Resistance, and other properties of an effect.</p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">• <strong>Roll (<i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-dice-d10\"></i>)</strong> Which Stat is rolled when activating this Metapower.</p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">• <strong>VS Roll (<i class=\"fa-duotone fa-solid fa-swords\"></i>)</strong> Which Stat is rolled by the target(s) as part of a VS roll when activating this Metapower. The defending party rolls passively, in most cases without them knowing. In case a Character purposefully wishes their defenses to be down, they can choose not to attempt that roll.</p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">• <strong>Activation️ (<i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-stopwatch\"></i>)</strong> Which part of my Turn does it take to Activate this Metapower. The Activation could take any Action Slot (Main Action, Extra Action, or Reaction), a Character’s Movement, or the entirety of a Turn, in the case of Focused Actions. Some Metapowers might have multiple Activation options.</p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">• <strong>Target (<i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-crosshairs-simple\"></i>)</strong> How many Targets, and which type are affected by this Metapower. Targets include both numerical values in the form of how many dice are rolled to determine how many targets are affected, which type of targets can only be targeted by this effect (such as Metanthropes, Humans, or Objects etc.), and a requirement of in which way the target needs to perceivable or detectable by the Character targeting (such as the target being Visible, Tangible, Detectable, etc.)</p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">• <strong>Duration (<i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hourglass-start\"></i>)</strong> How long does this Metapower lasts. All the Durations longer than a Round begin their countdown after the Turn they were Activated. For example, a Duration of a Cycle will end in a Cycle from when the effected was Activated, not when the current Cycle ends.</p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">• <strong>Range (<i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-ruler\"></i>)</strong> How far can you apply the Metapower's effect. In case the Metapower entry has multiple effects, more than one Ranges could be included into the summary of the Metapower.</p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">• <strong>Area Effect (<i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hexagon-image\"></i>)</strong> What is the Range of the Area Effect if any, that is included into the effect. Area Effects use the same Areas with Range, although they refer to the size and scope of the Area Effect instead.</p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">• <strong>Area Effect (Type)</strong> Which type of Area Effect is utilized among Line, Burst, Aura, Hemisphere, and Sphere.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Description</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The Metapower’s description includes how the activation of the Metapower looks, sounds, and feels in-game. It is a description which the Narrator can describe to the Player activating it and incorporate into the Scene they are on. Groups which wish to follow a more rules-light approach to the game and rely on the \"theater-of-mind\" more than tactical gameplay, can use this segment to know what the activation of the Metapower does, and how the rolls outcome may affect results.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Permanent Effects</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Here are include any effects which the Character receives passively (<i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-stopwatch\"></i>Activation: Always Active) and permanently (<i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hourglass-start\"></i>Duration: Permanent) just by unlocking the Metapower at the appropriate level. Here may be included <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-shield-halved\"></i> Buffs or other beneficiary effects. This segment could also include a table, or a picture to provide further information.</p><p></p><h2>Effect</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-square\"></i> = This section includes, in case the roll was successful, the resulting effect of the Metapower.</p><p></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> = Additional effects gained in case of accumulating one or more levels of Success. In case of including more than one additional effect this way by accumulating more <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i>, it will automatically include all the previous effects included, up to your total number of <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> accumulated. For example, if I accumulate <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i>, I additionally gain any effects offered by accumulating <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i>.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-square-check\"></i>= Additional effects gained in case of choosing to spend one or more of your accumulated <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i>. Including additional effect this way by spending <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i>, will have as a result the reduction of your total <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> accumulated. Spending <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-square-check\"></i> reduces the total number of the <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> accumulated. For example if I accumulate <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-check\"></i> and the Metapowered effect offers me the following options: <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-square-check\"></i> = <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hourglass-start\"></i> + 1d10 Cycles and <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-square-check\"></i><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-square-check\"></i><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-square-check\"></i> = <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-ruler\"></i> + 1 Area, then I can choose to increase the <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hourglass-start\"></i> by + 3d10 Cycles (three times) or Increase the <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-ruler\"></i> by + 1 Area (once).</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-xmark\"></i>= Negative effects gained instead of the original effect. In case the Character attempting the activation of the Metapower reaches or crosses the threshold of total <i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-xmark\"></i>accumulated which is presented in the Metapower – the activator of the effect receives these negative effects presented here instead of the normal activation's effect.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h3>[Alt] Effect</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Some levels of Metapowers might include Alternative [Alt] Effects. When choosing to Activate a level of a Metapower which has an [Alt] version, it must be chosen before rolling which effect is being attempted, the main or the [Alt] version. The [Alt] version might have its own Range, Targets, Durations etc. Other than that, activating an [Alt] Effect functions the similar way with activating any other, main, Effect.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p>"

Players can research different cultures, histories, accents, customs, ethnicities, and traditions to add as flavor to their Protagonist's roleplay. The Protagonist's appearance and clothing should be one that reflects the kind of story the Metanthrope is going to be involved in.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Lastly, set the Protagonist's Movement, Speed, Weight and Size to 10 and set their Resistances to 0, unless a Metapower they have unlocked offers a Buff which Permanently alters any of the above.

The Metamorphosis of a Metanthrope can take various forms - a single profound event, an ongoing process, a latent power that has existed since childhood, or a recent experience just before the beginning of the Saga.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>This Metamorphosis bestows upon your Protagonist their first Metapower, known as the Prime Metapower.</strong> The catalyst for a Metanthrope's Metamorphosis can be a driving force that motivates and defines their personality, or it could be a haunting memory from their past that they try to bury. Each Metanthrope's Metamorphosis is unique, and even those who share the same category of Metamorphosis can experience it and be influenced by it in vastly different ways.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Below, you will find ten different options for Metamorphosis. Consider these as suggestive ideas to build the foundation of your Protagonist's journey, rather than rigid guidelines for your roleplay. Each entry provides a brief introduction explaining how the Metamorphosis could have occurred in your Protagonist's life. Following the introduction of each option, there is a section called Roleplay Implications, which explores how the Metamorphosis may potentially shape your Protagonist's emotions, worldview, and interactions with the environment and others. For each Metamorphosis option, ten Prime Metapower recommendations are provided, but players are free to choose any combination of Metamorphosis and Prime Metapower that aligns with their Protagonist's profile. <strong>Drawing inspiration from the structure and concepts presented in the following options, Players can also collaborate with the Narrator to create their own unique Metamorphosis.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Cosmic Connection</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Your Metapowers are bestowed upon you by a cosmic source that exists beyond the confines of this world. The origin of your Cosmic Connection could be extraterrestrial or extradimensional in nature. Your Metamorphosis may have been triggered by an encounter with a cosmic phenomenon, interaction with a Spirit from another Dimension, a comet passing by, celestial alignment, or communication with an alien species, among other otherworldly sources. Since your Metamorphosis, you have been introduced to a vast and unfamiliar world, to which you feel a deep and profound connection.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplay Implications:</strong> Metanthropes with a Cosmic Connection as their Metamorphosis often have a heightened awareness of the intangible forces that shape reality. They are drawn to explore and understand the mysteries of the larger cosmos rather than focusing solely on the mundane world. They may urge the Coalition to explore the cosmos, emphasizing its importance over interference with human affairs. Alternatively, they may become consumed by their desire to re-establish their personal connection to the cosmic source, driving them to embark on personal investigations.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><i class=\"fa-kit fa-metanthropes\"></i>Prime Metapower recommendations:</strong> Aether Projection, Antikinesis, Augment Metapower, Control Density, Dark Energy Projection, Inner Dimension, Order Bending, Portal Projection, Singularity Powers, Time Bending, Transfer Metapower</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Dark Pact</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Through greed, coercion, or desperate circumstances, you have entered into a binding agreement with a malevolent entity, forging a Dark Pact that grants you Metapowers. The source of your newfound abilities is a mysterious being with overwhelming capabilities that has chosen to bestow you with a portion of its power. Your Metamorphosis may have been a conscious choice, a bargain struck to gain Metapowers, or you may have been thrust into the Pact without fully understanding its implications. This Dark Pact has irrevocably changed you, granting you extraordinary abilities that always come with a price.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplay Implications:</strong> Metanthropes with a Dark Pact as their origin may find themselves unwittingly serving the whims of a malevolent entity, or they may actively conceal the details of their Metamorphosis from other members of the Coalition. Some may constantly struggle to free themselves from the clutches of their Dark Pact, requiring assistance and support from their fellow Metanthropes. On the other hand, there are those who fully embrace their role and willingly submit to the desires of their dark masters, putting their world or Timeline at grave risk.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><i class=\"fa-kit fa-metanthropes\"></i>Prime Metapower recommendations:</strong> Chaos Bending, Craft Disease, Illusion Manipulation, Mirror Metapower, Negate Metapower, Nether Projection, Reanimation, Retrocognition, Warp Reality, Weaken Metapower</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Elemental Connection</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Your Metapowers derive from the very planet you inhabit or from neighboring celestial bodies such as the moon or the sun. It could be the result of encountering a powerful storm in the middle of the ocean, discovering a mystical cave deep within the earth, consuming a strange fruit found in the jungle, encountering a unique creature in a forest, or connecting with the energy of the atmosphere. This Elemental Connection may have been established through a rare and singular event or through an ongoing affinity with a particular element, plant, animal, or the circle of life.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplay Implications:</strong> Metanthropes with an Elemental Connection as their Metamorphosis prioritize the well-being of the natural world over the concerns of humanity. Depending on the exact source of their Metapowers, they may be drawn to environments where their associated element is abundant. Their connection could be linked to a specific elemental or natural force found within their environment. They view harm to their connected element as a personal affront and may align themselves with Coalitions dedicated to the protection and preservation of nature.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><i class=\"fa-kit fa-metanthropes\"></i>Prime Metapower recommendations:</strong> Acidokinesis, Aerokinesis, Animate Plants, Control Earth, Control Weather, Planetary Powers, Solar Imitation, Substance Generation, Thermal Powers, Zoopathy</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Freak Accident</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Your transformation into a Metanthrope is the result of a series of unforeseen and random events, known as a Freak Accident. This sudden and unexpected occurrence could be triggered by a temporal anomaly, a quantum confluence, an unpredictable series of events, exposed to radioactive energy, or even collateral damage in a conflict between Omnipowered beings. The Freak Accident abruptly and irrevocably changes your life, leaving everyone astonished by the transformation, as it appears to be outside of anyone’s machinations.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplay Implications:</strong> Metanthropes who have undergone a Freak Accident may carry the trauma of their experience, forever haunted by the events that led to their Metamorphosis. For others, the Freak Accident may give their life newfound purpose and define their identity. Some Metanthropes may dedicate themselves to preventing such accidents from happening again, while others may become obsessed with recreating the circumstances. The behavior and mindset of each Metanthrope will vary depending on the nature of their Freak Accident and the events surrounding it.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><i class=\"fa-kit fa-metanthropes\"></i>Prime Metapower recommendations:</strong> Control Dark Matter, Control Kinetic Energy, Craft Toxin, Electrokinesis, Light Projection, Meta Hearing, Pyrokinesis, Radiokinesis, Random Metapower, Seismokinesis</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Material Connection</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Your Metapowers are derived from a tangible source found within the Material Dimension, such as an object made of physical matter. It could be a cursed amulet, a lucky coin, or an ancient artifact with mystical properties. Alternatively, the Material Connection could be linked to any technological means, such as a high-tech gadget, a weapon, or a piece of armor. This connection could have been established by interacting with an item, vising a physical location, or utilizing any piece of technology to unlock your Metapowers.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplay Implications:</strong> Metanthropes with a Material Connection as their Metamorphosis origin tend to be fixated on their source of power. If it's an object, they may carry it with them at all times or rely on it to access their abilities. If it is located at a specific location, it must be visited frequently. If it has mystical or advanced technological properties, it have to be further researched, and it must never fall into the wrong hands. These Metanthropes may prioritize the preservation and protection of their Material Connection, often aligning themselves with Coalitions that share this focus.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><i class=\"fa-kit fa-metanthropes\"></i> Prime Metapower recommendations:</strong> Control Matter, Detect Matter, Duplicate Object, Duplicate Self, Forcefield Generation, Invisibility, Luck Bending, Meta Speed, Sizeshift</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Meta Bloodline</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Your Metanthrope status is rooted in your bloodline, with the Metapowers flowing within your veins from generations past. Whether you were born with these abilities or unlocked them later in life, they are an innate part of you. The lineage of Metanthropes in your family tree, whether known or unknown, plays a significant role in your Metamorphosis. It connects you to a heritage that can be traced back to the origins of these extraordinary powers, and you have the potential to pass them down to future generations.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplay Implications:</strong> Metanthropes of a Meta Bloodline are often deeply curious about their family history and seek to honor the traditions and legacy of their lineage. They might keep the existence of their ancestry a secret, or carry it with pride. Uncovering the secrets and stories of their ancestors becomes a driving force in their journey. Their pursuit of self-discovery, the preservation of their bloodline, and its succession to future generations, may lead such Metanthropes to make decisions that involve the fate of the Coalition , whether they want it or not.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><i class=\"fa-kit fa-metanthropes\"></i> Prime Metapower recommendations:</strong> Biomorphic Powers, Hydrokinesis, Immortality, Life Restoration, Lunar Connection, Meta Strength, Meta Taste, Meta Touch, Pheromone Manipulation, Precognition</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Psychic Connection</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Your Metapowers originate from the intangible and unseen realms, specifically from a Psychic Connection that exists within your mind or any Psychic-based Dimension. This connection could manifest as telepathic communication with an mysterious entity or a collective consciousness, hearing a voice during meditation or prayer, being the receiver of a signal emission, or experiencing dreams that materialize into reality. The source of your Psychic Connection may have an influence on your actions or simply act as a transmitter of powerful Psychic energies, the reasons for which remain unknown to you.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplay Implications:</strong> Metanthropes with a Psychic Connection as their Metamorphosis origin are drawn to the realm of thoughts, emotions, and the collective consciousness of sentient beings. They may find themselves navigating the complexities of society, taking on leadership roles or becoming outcasts due to their unique abilities. Their behavior within society is diverse, with some using their powers for manipulation and control, others for self-discovery and testing their limits, while others might strive to guide others into esoteric journeys into the recesses of their mind.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><i class=\"fa-kit fa-metanthropes\"></i> Prime Metapower recommendations:</strong> Ancestral Connection, Animate Objects, Astral Projection, Detect Metapower, Memory Manipulation, Mind Control, Mind Swap, Spirit Manipulation, Telekinesis, Telepathy</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Scientific Experiment</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Your transformation into a Metanthrope is the result of a Scientific Experiment conducted on you. Whether as a willing volunteer or a coerced participant, you became the subject of experimental procedures or treatments that unlocked your Metapowers. The circumstances surrounding your Scientific Experiment could range from unexpected positive results to unforeseen consequences, to an experiment gone wrong. You may have been the first test subject, known as patient zero, subjected to years of experimentation. The experiment could be biogenetic, or cybernetic in nature, or tampering with forces unknown.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplay Implications:</strong> The circumstances of the Scientific Experiment shape a Metanthrope's development and outlook. Their behavior could vary from victim mentalities to eerie determined personalities. Metanthropes who were forced into the experiment may seek to find the reason why, or retribution against those who exploited them, even if they gained Metapowers as a result. On the other hand, Metanthropes who volunteered for the experiment may feel a sense of responsibility to protect and assist the organization or individuals conducting the experiments.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><i class=\"fa-kit fa-metanthropes\"></i>Prime Metapower recommendations:</strong> Alter Energy, Alter Sound, Atomokinesis, Control Gravity, Control Magnetism, Dark Energy Projection, Quantum Projection, Substance Imitation, Teleport</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Selective Evolution</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Your Metanthrope existence is the result of a significant leap in evolution. Due to a rare genetic mutation, your DNA contains the encrypted secrets of your incredible abilities. Your Metapowers might have manifested at adolescence, or after a specific event in your life, that pushed you to your limits. You may be part of a new generation of Metapowered people, or the first of your kind, representing the next step in the evolutionary chain. Your Metapowers are innate, evolved on their own, and an integral part of your being, forever tying you to the evolution of your species.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplay Implications:</strong> Metanthropes with Selective Evolution as their Metamorphosis often view themselves as free, independent beings. Although there might be some who have not embraced their newfound status yet, others consider themselves fortunate or superior to others who require gadgets or external means to activate their Metapowers. However, they are also aware that their genetic uniqueness makes them targets for study and potential replication. These Metanthropes often find camaraderie, and a sense of community and understanding among others of their kind, forming strong connections.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><i class=\"fa-kit fa-metanthropes\"></i>Prime Metapower recommendations:</strong> Adaptive Imitation, Elasticity, Flight, Intangibility, Meta Reflexes, Meta Smell, Meta Vision, Regeneration, Shapeshift</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Self-Made</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>You are solely responsible for your Metapowers, which you have achieved through your own efforts and ingenuity. Whether through a spiritual awakening, intense training, a ritualistic encounter, or devotion to a specific practice, you have intentionally and purposefully become a Metanthrope. You are the sole responsible for unlocking your Metapowers, and you have achieved it through hard work, and dedication. By unveiling your abilities to the world, you also reveal your method of becoming a Metanthrope, which may be unique to you and potentially coveted or exploited by others.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplay Implications:</strong> Self-Made Metanthropes tend to be highly competent, eccentric, secretive, and independent individuals. Most likely, they will continue to practice the way that caused their Metamorphosis. They attract the attention and curiosity of human and Metanthrope society, often considering themselves part of it. The knowledge, the process, and the method of their Self-Made Metamorphosis may lead them to form alliances within a Coalition for protection against those who seek to uncover their secrets or cause them harm.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong><i class=\"fa-kit fa-metanthropes\"></i> Prime Metapower recommendations:</strong> 6th Sense, Hypnotic Manipulation, Meta Charisma, Meta Cognition, Meta Empathy, Meta Evocation, Meta Ingenuity, Meta Will</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p>"

The Arc embodies the archetype your Protagonist represents.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Successfully roleplaying your Protagonist's Arc in each Scene will earn you Destiny, based on in-game circumstances and your level of engagement. By roleplaying your Arc, you fulfill your Protagonist's destiny and follow the path they are meant to tread.</strong> Players have the freedom to change their Protagonist's Arc at the end of each Act of a Saga if their current Arc no longer aligns with their Metanthrope. This change symbolizes growth, development, and maturity in the Metanthrope's journey.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Below, you will find ten sample Arc options. It's important to note that two Metanthropes with the same Arc can subscribe to opposing ideologies yet approach problems in similar ways and employ similar methods. Each entry provides a brief introduction to how the Arc impacts roleplay from the Protagonist's perspective. Following the introduction, there is a section called Roleplay Implications, which describes how the Arc may influence a Protagonist's emotions, worldview, and interactions with the environment and others. Lastly, guidelines on earning Destiny through roleplaying each Arc are provided. <strong>Players may choose any of the ten Arc options presented or collaborate with the Narrator to create their own, drawing inspiration from and following the structure of the options below.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Architect</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>You are a creator and innovator, able to conceive groundbreaking designs and pioneer the blueprints of the future. You yearn to construct everlasting structures, develop innovative devices, and establish new theories. As an Architect, your purpose is to solve problems by offering fresh solutions, articulating your ideas, and bringing them to life.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Architects are known for their out-of-the-box thinking and their ability to provide new ideas to the Coalition. They formulate plans, and they can be the ones who build the means to complete them. They thrive in times of peace and prosperity, when they have the time and freedom to design and construct. There is always something waiting to be created that can contribute to a solution.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you contribute new theoretical or practical solutions to established problems. Gain additional Destiny when your plans, designs, or constructions have a tangible impact on the lives of others.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Autocrat</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Your destiny is to rule over humans and Metanthropes alike, under a single banner and cause - your own. You always gravitate towards commanding roles and embrace the responsibilities of decision-making. The weight of leadership may be heavy, but you believe that you are the only one worthy of shouldering it. This world deserves better leadership, and it is your destiny to provide it.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Autocrats often strive to gain control over the Coalition they are part of. They may employ political maneuvering to establish their sovereignty. Once in power, some Autocrats use their authority to inspire and enact positive change, while others demand absolute sovereign and become dictators. Autocrats understand that their path is long and treacherous, and many might challenge their authority along the way.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny when your leadership proves beneficial, and when your decision-making is proven to be the best course of action. Gain additional Destiny when new individuals willingly accept your leadership.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Catalyst</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>As a Catalyst, your driving force is to seek profound change and transformation, both within yourself and in the environment and people around you. You are constantly pushing for progress, challenging the status quo, and catalyzing shifts in beliefs, systems, and ideologies. For you nothing remains static, and old institutions must undergo profound change. Your purpose is to ignite a spark of revolution in others and reshape the world.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Catalysts are charismatic, influential, and inspiring individuals who naturally compel others to take action. They possess a unique talent for identifying the potential in people and situations, inspiring social change, and guiding others on personal journeys of growth and self-discovery. Their very presence has a transformative effect, pushing everything towards evolution and profound shifts in reality.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you inspire others and initiate change in the environment or people's lives. Gain additional Destiny when your transformations have a far-reaching impact to their Coalition, and the world at large.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Harmonizer</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>As a Harmonizer, you are focused on promoting unity, stability, and collaboration within Metanthrope and human society, as well as any other factions. You strive to bridge divides and find common ground, even in the face of deep-seated conflicts. Your ultimate goal is to bring together disparate groups, foster understanding, and create a harmonious coexistence that benefits all.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Harmonizers excel in negotiations, and peacekeeping efforts. They navigate complex social dynamics and address the concerns of both sides, working towards diplomatic solutions to conflicts. Harmonizers actively seek to mend broken relationships, facilitate dialogue, and promote cooperation. Their role may involve mediating conflicts, forging alliances, and representing the interests of their Coalition in social interactions.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny when you mediate conflicts, forge alliances, and promote understanding among different factions. Gain additional Destiny when your efforts lead to long-lasting harmony, stable relationships, and a more united community.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Herald</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>You possess profound knowledge that others do not, becoming the bearer of important tidings. It is your role to inform the rest of the world about upcoming changes, threats, or opportunities. Whether you are a prophet of impending disaster or an evangelist of the new world order, it is your task to convince others to heed your call.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Heralds may receive glimpses of the future through encounters with Omnipotent beings, their own visions, or through extensive studies and calculations. Their duty is to share their discoveries with others, starting within their own Coalition. Heralds do not determine the course of action; instead, they act as messengers, sharing their insights.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny when you convince others of your visions, studies, or encounters. Gain additional Destiny when your revelations not only influence the mindset but also the actions of those who listen to your message.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Investigator</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>You possess a natural inclination towards investigation and have a keen eye for solving mysteries. Every enigma you encounter is a case to be solved. Your purpose is to delve into the research, study, uncover clues, connect the dots, and unravel the puzzles presented to you. Since your Metamorphosis, you have been exposed to a plethora of cosmic secrets and paradoxes, and you are driven to solve them.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Investigators are driven individuals who are willing to push boundaries and break rules in pursuit of solving their cases. Obsessed Investigators prioritize their investigations above all else, often causing disruptions within their Coalition. The thrill of solving mysteries, deciphering codes, and uncovering hidden truths motivates Investigators more than anything else.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny when you solve mysteries, puzzles, riddles, learn secrets, or uncover conspiracies. Gain additional Destiny when you display unwavering determination and go to any lengths necessary to find the answers you seek.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Naturalist</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>As a Naturalist, you have fully embraced the primordial way and the connection with the untamed forces of nature. You find solace and purpose in the raw beauty and wisdom of the natural world. Your heart beats in symphony with the rhythms of the earth, and you hold a deep reverence for the delicate balance of nature. Your mission is to protect and preserve the natural order, advocating for the well-being of animals, plants, and ecosystems.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Naturalists immerse themselves in the wild expanses, finding communion with nature and its inhabitants. They reject the trappings of society, embracing tranquility. Often found in the heart of untouched wilderness, they observe the intricacies of the natural world, seeking to deepen their understanding of its wonders.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you champion the preservation of pristine wilderness, safeguard lifeforms, and restore the environment. Gain additionally Destiny when you unleash the wrath of nature upon those who harm and disrupt the natural order.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Predator</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>As a Predator, you possess a primal mindset that does not fit within civilized society. Your yearning is to become the apex predator, dominating the food chain wherever you find yourself. The awakening of your Metanthrope status has unleashed the feral hunter within you, and everyone you meet is potential prey. The world becomes your domain, and you live for the thrill of the hunt.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Predators have a tendency to disregard agendas and causes, instead following their instincts. They view the world as their hunting ground, caring little for rules, morality, or social structures. While Predators can prove challenging companions within a non-like-minded Coalition, their skills in tracking down and eliminating threats make them invaluable assets.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you embrace your inner savage and showcase your superiority your peers. Gain additional Destiny when you successfully hunt down worthy prey or neutralize threats to their domain.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Protector</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>As a Protector, the Metapowers bestowed upon you serve a noble purpose: to protect those who cannot protect themselves. You stand vigilant in the face of any threat, regardless of the odds. Defending those you care about is its own reward, and it is your duty to be there when they are in need, shielding them from harm at any cost.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> The focus of a Protector's care could be a specific person or group of beings, a place, an item, or even an ideal. Their caretaking nature often extends to all members of the Coalition, and anyone around them not capable of defending themselves. Protectors prioritize everyone being safe, above the completion of any mission.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny when you successfully prevent harm from befalling to those you are meant to protect, especially in dire, life-threatening situations. Gain additional Destiny whenever you risk your own life and well-being to fulfill your protective duties.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Wayfarer</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>As a Wayfarer, your purpose as a Metanthrope is to explore new lands, planets, star systems, galaxies, and Dimensions. Nothing holds you back from boldly venturing into uncharted territories. Your quest is to witness indescribable celestial phenomena and be the first to visit undiscovered landscapes of this world and beyond.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Navigators typically oversee exploration and transportation within their Coalition. They usually have the means to directly visit extraterrestrial or extradimensional locations and transport themselves and other Coalition members between locations. For a Wayfarer, exploration, discovery, and adventure are the ultimate pursuits.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you discover new locations, landscapes, climates, cultures, civilizations, and encounter entities native to these unexplored realms. Gain additional Destiny when you are the first ever to accomplish these feats.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p>"

            "content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Regression is a fundamental aspect of a Metanthrope's existence, representing their connection to their human origins. It encompasses the reversion to human behaviors, quirks, and attachments that persist despite their ascension.</strong> Regressions can manifest as unique knacks, idiosyncrasies, nostalgic attachments, or self-imposed restrictions. It is important to recognize that Regression is not considered a weakness, as it can be a source of strength, adding depth, drama, complexity, and inner conflict to a Metanthrope’s roleplay. Every Metanthrope possesses a Regression, whether they openly embrace it, keep it hidden, or are unaware of its existence.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying your Protagonist's Regression during each Scene allows you to fulfill their destiny and stay true to their path. By embodying their Regression, you gain Destiny based on your involvement and the circumstances in-game.</strong> As a Player, you have the freedom to change your Protagonist's Regression at the end of each Act of a Saga if you feel it no longer represents their evolving identity. This symbolizes their growth, development, and maturity as a Metanthrope.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Below, you will find ten sample Regression options. It's important to note that two Metanthropes with the same Regression can vastly vary when it comes to their behavioral patterns. Each entry provides a brief introduction to how the Regression impacts roleplay from the Protagonist's perspective. Each Regression option is accompanied by Roleplay Implications that explore how it influences a Protagonist's emotions, worldview, and interactions with the environment and others. Additionally, guidelines for earning Destiny through roleplaying each Regression are provided. <strong>While Players can choose from the ten pre-defined Regression options, they are also encouraged to collaborate with the Narrator to create unique Regressions that align with the structure of the options presented below.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Anachronism</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>The Anachronism Regression manifests as an anachronistic attachment, a deep affinity for a specific time period or historical era. This attachment is not limited to the past but could extend to the future instead. You are drawn to the customs, fashion, art, and ideals of their chosen era. Their anachronistic tendencies are evident in your appearance, speech, and choice of activities, making you stand out from others.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Metanthropes with the Anachronism Regression bring a unique perspective on time to their interactions and experiences. Their knowledge of history or understanding of future trends and technologies allow them to provide valuable insights and alternative solutions in various situations. However, their anachronistic nature can also pose challenges when navigating contemporary society.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you seamlessly blend elements from different eras into your daily life. Gain additional Destiny when your anachronistic tendencies lead to unexpected opportunities whether it be through uncovering wisdom from the past or foreseeing future developments.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Artisan</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>As a Metanthrope with the Artisan Regression, you find solace and fulfillment in pursuing a hobby or talent that has nothing to do with your Metapowers. Whether it's singing, writing, painting, or any other creative pursuit, this passion provides you with a sense of balance and a connection to your human side. Amidst the complexities of your new existence, you hold onto the simplicity and joy that this hobby brings.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Metanthropes with the Artisan Regression are often seen as eccentric, immersed in their craft and lost in their own world. They seek to refine their talent, dedicating time to training and seeking guidance to further their artistry. Their focus on their art can make them seem detached from the concerns of the Metanthrope world. However, their artistic expression offers perspective to the experiences of the Coalition.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny when you express themselves artistically, even in perilous times when others may overlook the importance of such pursuits. Gain additional Destiny when you inspire others to appreciate the beauty and significance found in creative expression.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Beloveds</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Your love interest is the most important thing in your life. It can be your significant other, your human family or best friend, or even your pet. You hold your loved ones in higher esteem than even your Coalition, your Metanthrope status, or even your own life. Others might misunderstand your reasoning, your motives, and your methods, but they may never have felt the way you do about your beloved.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Metanthropes with Beloveds in their lives want to keep them close and safe at all times. Such Metanthropes could prove to be extra motivated and helpful to the Coalition, especially if the task at hand will bring joy or benefits their Beloveds. Issues may arise when this bond is maintained at inappropriate times, in ways that may jeopardize the Coalition.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you can include your Beloveds in your everyday life and show your appreciation for them. Gain additional Destiny when you manage to keep them close to you even during life-threatening or bizarre situations.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Consensus</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>You are greatly concerned with your reputation and how humans view Metanthropes. It is paramount that Metanthropes are seen in a positive light and maintain a good relationship with the humans of the world they share. You must clean up the messes caused by Metanthropes that do not share your values, and sometimes, this may involve concealing massive scandals that have the potential to taint the Metanthrope reputation.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Metanthropes fixated on public Consensus will spend a lot of their time crafting their public image and painting their Coalition and the Metanthrope community in a good light. They will abide by human laws, and customs, and push other Coalition members to do so. Such Metanthropes will do anything to keep and maintain a clean image, even if it is only an illusion.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you showcase the proper image for all Metanthropes worldwide through your opinions and even more so, your actions. Gain additional Destiny whenever you convince your Coalition and any other Metanthropes to behave accordingly.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Disbelief</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>You are in a state of disbelief regarding the latest events happening in your life. Ever since the incident, which others call your Metamorphosis, you witness and experience unexplainable things. Even if Metanthropes are real, you do not feel like you are one of them. You could be hallucinating, the victim of an elaborate prank, trapped in a dream, or simply questioning your sanity.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Many Metanthropes express this Regression during the first days after their Metamorphosis. Others, due to a variety of reasons, still maintain this Disbelief long after. These reasons could include lack of evidence, a traumatic event, distrust of oneself, or the perception that their Metapowers have not manifested in a way that is perceivable and understood.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you manage to reasonably convince yourself that you are not a Metanthrope (even when you activate Metapowers). Gain additional Destiny whenever your arguments and points manage to convince or perplex other Metanthropes about their nature or their reality.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Heritage</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>With the Heritage Regression, you maintain a deep connection to your cultural or ancestral roots. The traditions, customs, and values of your Heritage hold great significance for you, serving as a source of your identity. Your upbringing and cultural background continues to shape your worldview and influence your actions. The legacy of your forebears resonates within you, guiding your values, choices, and sense of self.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Metanthropes with the Heritage Regression actively preserve and promote their cultural heritage within the Coalition. They engage in cultural practices, celebrate festivals, and seek connections with others who share their heritage. Embracing their lineage, they navigate the delicate balance between personal desires and the expectations of tradition.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny when you make decisions that honor or align with your family's legacy or ancestral traditions. Gain additional Destiny when you confront challenges and dilemmas that test your commitment to your legacy, prioritizing actions that uphold the values of your heritage.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Materialism</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>You are a slave to your unquenching thirst for material wealth. You are drawn to commodities, money, gems, souvenirs, trinkets, indulgences, and gadgets. With your Metapowers, you can now have the things you craved as a human: luxurious commodities, a lavish lifestyle, and all the marbles. You can finally use your newfound Metapowers to obtain everything you ever wanted.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Metanthropes regressing to Materialism will hoard any item they are after, often endangering their Coalition to obtain them. They expressed a repressed desire to riches and wealth, that was often devoid from their human lives. Intangible rewards mean little to them in comparison to the shiny things they desire. Materialist Metanthropes will rarely join a mission without any physical reward, even if the world is at stake.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you obtain material wealth you could never obtain as a human. Gain additional Destiny when you convince others to help you in your treasure hunts or willingly hand over their unwanted material wealth.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Overenthusiasm</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Turning out to be a Metanthrope was the best thing that ever happened to you, by far. You do not understand how each other Metanthrope is not equally thrilled about having Metapowers. From a young age, you yearned to have extraordinary abilities and continued daydreaming about superpowers as an adult. Now you cannot wait to share your enthusiasm with the rest of your kin and the whole world too.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> Overenthusiastic Metanthropes will trouble other Metanthropes they encounter and brazenly ask about their Metapowers and showcase their own at every opportunity. For some Coalition members, this ever-burning flame is merely annoying, and for others, it is completely draining. Even so, overenthusiastic Metanthropes tend to boost Coalition morale.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em><i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-hand-fingers-crossed\"></i> Gain Destiny whenever you express your Overenthusiasm, at inappropriate, or perilous times. Gain additional Destiny whenever you infect others, especially those outside of your Coalition with your Overenthusiasm.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Persona</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Each time you publicly present yourself as a Metanthrope or activate your Metapowers in the presence of others, you must do so under an alias, an alter ego, or a secret identity – your Persona.

You must make sure no one finds out your identity, leave no clue to trace back to you, and no witnesses who can expose your identity.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplaying Implications:</strong> The reason behind having a Persona is to ensure that there are no correlations between you as Metanthrope and the identity they try to maintain a secret in society. The deeper reasoning could vary from individual to individual, but the drive behind any Metanthrope with this Regression is the same.

Perks give access to specific techniques, information, fields of study, and technical know-how on order to use certain Possessions. <strong>Furthermore, Perks offers additional depth and development to a Protagonist, which differs from their Metapowered arsenal.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Perks are categorized into Knowledge and Skills. <strong>Knowledge refers to abilities developed through studying theories, learning thesis and theorems, and performing simulations and experiments. Skills refer to abilities that develop through practical appliance, repetition and practicing them in the field.</strong> The following table showcases the 10 Perks which consist of 5 Knowledge and 5 Skills.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><img src=\"systems/metanthropes/assets/artwork/tables/perks.webp\" class=\" centered\" /><p style=\"text-align:center\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Perks are neither tied to any Metapower, nor to any Stat.</strong> A Character in possession of the Metapower: Control Gravity does not necessarily mean that they have to possess the Knowledge: Science. Having both of them might offer a certain circumstantial edge, according to the situation in-game and the Narrator’s discretion. Similarly, the Knowledge: Medicine could be applied when attempted a Perception roll to diagnose a medical condition, and to a Creativity roll whenever attempting to patch-up an open wound.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Unlocking &amp; Progressing Perks</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Perks range from Level 1 (novice) to Level 5 (master). Newly created Protagonists start the game with two (or possibly more, depending on their story) Perks offered by the Narrator without the need to spend any Experience. After each Act of a Saga, additional free Perks may be offered, according to the achievements and studies of the Protagonist, at the Narrator's discretion. <strong>The Experience cost of unlocking the first level in a new Perk and progressing it to higher levels is 100 per level unlocked or progressed.</strong> Since learning new Perks takes time, besides spending the Experience, a Character who wishes to advance a Perk once the story began, must spend some time in-game training and honing their craft. This time can usually be spent during any Downtime of the story.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>After the story has began, a Character can spend time training by studying handbooks, receiving tutoring, participating in lectures, watching seminars, and practicing every day.</strong> The amount of time required is based on whether the Perk is a Knowledge or a Skill (Knowledges require significantly more amount of time), and the desired Perk level, as seen in the following table.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>A Character which is spending time training, must spend the majority of the day focusing on their training.</strong> It is possible to reduce the in-game time requirements through Metapowered means (such as the Metapowers Meta Evocation and Meta Intelligence) and, at the Narrator’s discretion, through other in-game shortcuts, such as being taught by an extraordinary tutor or by allowing Downtime rolls to decrease the amount of total time needed.</p><p></p><img src=\"systems/metanthropes/assets/artwork/tables/perks-time-required.webp\" class=\" centered\" /><p style=\"text-align:center\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Unlocking and advancing a Perk for a new Protagonist</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>I created a new Protagonist and want to have Artistry at Level 3; I must spend a total of 300 Experience.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Advancing a Perk during a Downtime</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>During a Downtime I spend 200 Experience to advance my Knowledge: Engineering from Level 2 to Level 4. Additionally, my Protagonist spends a total of One Year and Six Months of training in-game time.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">For more about gaining and spending Experience, see @UUID[.mStXk1UPdF9zzQZQ]{<i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-chart-line-up\"></i> Experience}</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Knowledge</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Each level of a Perk: Knowledge, offers the Character unlocking or progressing it a field of study. A field of study is a specialization the Character has within the greater field of Knowledge. Each Knowledge listed below offers a list of available fields of study, but a Player may, in collaboration with the Narrator, come up with their own fields of study. <strong>Having a Knowledge at higher level not only gives access to further fields of study, but also increases the Character's overall mastery of a certain Perk.</strong> Using some Possessions or making certain computations in-game requires having a specific knowledge level. Characters attempting to use an Item, or a technique without having attained the required Knowledge level, cannot attempt that roll. At the Narrator’s discretion, Protagonists who have spent significant amount of time learning something in-game, may attempt a Knowledge-based roll with a Penalty.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>How Knowledge requirements function</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>I want my Protagonist to estimate the trajectory of a space rocket entering the atmosphere. The Narrator informs me that my Protagonist requires having the Knowledge: Engineering with a selected field of study at rocket propulsion, and the Knowledge: Science with astrophysics as a selected field of study. Additionally, the Narrator decides that both Knowledges need to be at level 4 or higher to make the appropriate correct calculations, and correctly estimate the rocket’s projection.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"></p><h3>Academics</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Academics offer a Character access to educational, cultural, social, and historical fields of knowledge.</strong> In addition to the fields of study, each Level at Academics provides the Character with additional foreign languages.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Example fields of study:</strong> Psychology, Anthropology, Philosophy, Sociology, Literature, Linguistics, Hieroglyphics, Archeology, Law, History</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><ol start=\"0\"><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><em>Your Academic knowledge is equivalent to that of a high-school graduate.

            "content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This section will elaborate on how Players can accumulate and to spend Experience. Experience is a game currency that is given to Players by the Narrator at the beginning of each new Session. Players gain Experience through their roleplay and the actions their Protagonists accomplish in-game. <strong>Protagonists start with a starting amount of Experience their Players can spent to develop them. Unless the Narrator states otherwise, that amount is 1000 Experience.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Some One-Shot Sessions or Sagas may offer different amount of Experience, according to the story and the severity of the adversity the Coalition is about to face. <strong>When it comes to rewarding further Experience, can only be done during Sagas, or One-Shot stories which extend to additional Sessions.</strong> Purely One-Shot experiences shall award no Experience, and there will be no further development of the Protagonists.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Experience as a resource is Player-bound and not Protagonist-bound.</strong> All Experience gathered and spent by a Player during a Saga for their current Protagonist can be transferred to that Player’s next Protagonist in case of an untimely death of a Protagonist or in case a Player wants to abandon their current Character and create a new one.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">For more about new Protagonists, see @UUID[.bjWMvlWDwsU319DF]{New Characters}</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">For more about a Protagonist's death, see @UUID[Compendium.metanthropes.welcome.JournalEntry.8tVVlGzZE4KriD12.JournalEntryPage.RJ71fneUufIAxRMZ#death]{Death}</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Awarding Experience</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The amount of Experience awarded to each Player by the Narrator at the beginning of each new Session is based on the performance of the Protagonists and the events their Protagonists experienced during the last Session. <strong>The categories on which upon awarding Experience are based are the following: Roleplay, Acting, Goals, Adversity, Discovery, Influence.</strong> Those criteria are explained in detail in the segment below. The Experience awarded increases with the passing of each Session played. The specific amount of Experience awarded is ultimately based at the Narrator’s discretion.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><ol><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roleplay:</strong> Roleplaying who your Protagonist is. Considering not only a Protagonist's general concept, Background, Metamorphosis, Arc and Regression but also the Character's ideologies, morals, code of conduct, childhood, ambitions, goals, fears, regrets, trauma, dreams, conscious and subconscious decisions and finally the in-game experiences that molded the Protagonist after the beginning of the story.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Acting:</strong> Embodying your Protagonist. Changing the voice, tone, way of standing, mannerisms, eccentricities, idiosyncrasies, quirks, and any intense and memorable performances. The more distinct is the line between in-game and out-of-game the more Experience is awarded.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Goals:</strong> Setting new goals and striving to succeed them. Laying detailed plans on how to archive them and working towards achieving them. There are personal goals for each Protagonist, and collective goals all members of a Coalition are striving towards. Setting serious goals is important, but ultimately more Experience is awarded when achieving them.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Adversity:</strong> Confronting and overcoming challenges. Facing and overcoming adversity in form of a Character's phobias or Antagonists, and dealing with daring and life-threating situations. Recklessness without reason, winning or surviving out of pure luck, masochistic and self-destructive behaviors should not be equally rewarded with facing true adversity.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Discovery:</strong> Exploring new landscapes and ideologies. Discovering more about the Cosmos and the world the Protagonist lives in, meeting new important Characters, encountering the use of new Metapowers, visiting new lands or new Dimensions, meeting new ideologies, learning new lore, disillusioning old lies, unraveling plots and demystifying the veil of the unknown.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Influence:</strong> Change the world, and the lives of the people who live in it. Influencing the world by changing mindsets of other Characters, overpowering old regimes, altering the reality and worldview of others, bringing down systems and raising new ones, inspiring revolutions, and synthesizing new philosophies, ideologies, and beliefs.</p></li></ol><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Spending Experience</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Experience can be spent to unlock new Metapowers and Perks, progress them to higher levels, and to advance Characteristics or Stats.</strong> Players can spend this Experience to progress their Protagonists before the first Scene of the new Session begins. Alternatively, Players can choose to store their Experience for later use. Narrators can progress their NPCs in a similar way that Protagonists do, or follow any other alternative method of progression.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h3>Progressing Characteristics</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Characters can progress their Characteristics by spending Experience. When progressing Characteristics, a Player is progressing their Protagonists base Characteristic. The base Characteristic is equal to their starting number of that Characteristic, plus any previous progressions by spending Experience. Base Characteristic do not include any increases from any type of Buffs, or decreases from any type of Conditions. <strong>The cost of progressing a Characteristic is equal to: The Characteristic’s base score * 10. Each progression increases the Characteristic by + 5%. A Character can progress the same Characteristic up to five times total.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Progressing Characteristics</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>My Soul is at 10% and I want to progress it. I must spend 10 * 10 = 100 Experience. My Soul Characteristic now becomes 15%. I want to progress it one more time, and now the new cost is 15 * 10 = 150 Experience, and my new score would become 20%.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h3>Progressing Stats</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Characters can progress their Stats by spending Experience. When progressing Stats, a Player is progressing their Protagonists base Stat. The base Stat is equal to their starting number of that Characteristic (which includes the base from the Stat's Characteristic), plus any previous progressions by spending Experience. Base Stats do not include any increases from any type of Buffs, or decreases from any type of Conditions. <strong>The cost of progressing a Stat is equal to: The Stat’s current score * 3. Each progression increases the Stat by + 5%. A Character can advance the same Stat up to five times total.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Progressing Stats</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>My Perception is at 35% and I want to progress it. I must spend 35 * 3 = 105 Experience. My Perception Stat now becomes 40%. I want to progress it one more time and now the new cost is 40 * 3 = 120 Experience, and my new score would become 45%.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">For more about Characteristics and Stats, see @UUID[JournalEntry.8tVVlGzZE4KriD12.JournalEntryPage.iyhYr3JaNDadAp9F]{<i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-chart-simple\"></i> Characteristics &amp; Stats}</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h3>Progressing &amp; Unlocking Perks</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Characters can unlock new Perks or progress their existing ones by spending Experience. <strong>The cost for unlocking new Perks and progressing Perks is 100. Progressing Perks once the story has began requires in-game training time.</strong> Non-newly created Characters, without the aid of Metapowers, cannot learn new skills and knowledges overnight. Once the Saga has begun, Characters need to spend time in-game learning their new Perks in addition to spending Experience for them.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Progressing Perks</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>I want to unlock a new Perk for my newly created Protagonist. The Experience costs for unlocking that Perk is 100. During a downtime, I want to progress that Perk to level 4, doing so requires an additional 300 Experience.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">For more about Perks and the time required training, see @UUID[.bI8yBqlTn7fl7H6S]{<i class=\"fa-sharp-duotone fa-solid fa-books\"></i> Perks}</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h2>Prime Metapower</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The very first Metapower a Metanthrope unlocks is considered the Metanthrope’s Prime Metapower. <strong>The act of the Metanthrope’s Metamorphosis unlocks the first level of the Prime Metapower for free. The Prime Metapower modulates game progression, as a Character cannot obtain any Metapower at a level beyond that of their Prime Metapower.</strong></p><p></p><img src=\"systems/metanthropes/assets/artwork/journals/matching-classifications.webp\" class=\" centered\" /><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Each Metapower has a Classification and an Energy Type. There are ten Classifications (<em>Aegis, Controller, Animator, Manipulator, Arbiter, Clairvoyant, Cosmonaut, Kineticist, Hammer and Utilitarian</em>) and four Energy Types (<em>Cosmic, Elemental, Material, Psychic</em>). The experience costs of unlocking and progressing additional Metapowers beyond one's Prime Metapower differ according to the Classification and Energy Type of a Metanthrope’s Prime Metapower. <strong>Each Classification matches with two neighboring and synergizing Classifications. Two identical Classifications are also considered to be matching with each other. All other Classifications are considered non-matching.</strong> Metapower Energy Types can be the same or different.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><img src=\"systems/metanthropes/assets/artwork/tables/classifications-matching.webp\" class=\" centered\" /><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h3>Progressing &amp; Unlocking Metapowers</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">When unlocking a new Metapower or progressing a current one, the Player must check the Classification and Energy Type of the new Metapower compares to the Prime Metapower’s Classification and Energy Type. <strong>One exception is the Classification: Utilitarian. This special Classification considers only the Energy Type of other Metapowers and has reduced Experience costs.</strong> Summing up all possible combinations between matching and non-matching Classifications and same or different Energy Types, as well as including the special costs of the Utilitarian Classification, six different Experience cost Tiers are created, as seen in the following table.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><img src=\"systems/metanthropes/assets/artwork/tables/classifications-tiers.webp\" class=\" centered\" /><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><ul><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Tier 1:</strong> The new unlocked or progressing Metapower has the same or matching Classifications with the Prime Metapower, and the same Energy Type.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Tier 2:</strong> The new unlocked or progressing Metapower has the same or matching Classifications with the Prime Metapower but has a different Energy Type.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Tier 3: T</strong>he new unlocked or progressing Metapower is the Utilitarian Classification, or the Prime Metapower is Utilitarian Classification, and the new unlocked or progressing Metapower has the same Energy Type.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Tier 4:</strong> The new unlocked or progressing Metapower is the Utilitarian Classification, or the Prime Metapower is Utilitarian Classification, but the new unlocked or progressing Metapower has a different Energy Type.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Tier 5:</strong> The new unlocked or progressing Metapower has a non-matching Classification with the Prime Metapower and the same Energy Type.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Tier 6:</strong> The new unlocked or progressing Metapower has a non-matching Classification with the Prime Metapower but has a different Energy Type.</p></li></ul><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><img src=\"systems/metanthropes/assets/artwork/tables/progression-per-level.webp\" class=\" centered\" /><p></p><img src=\"systems/metanthropes/assets/artwork/tables/progression-max.webp\" class=\" centered\" /><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Unlocking a new Tier 1 Metapower</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>My Prime Metapower is Meta Strength which has Classification: Hammer and Energy Type: Material.

In a TTRPG, the Players aren’t just passive observers. Instead, they become the Protagonists of an evolving story, shaped by their actions and decisions. A story orchestrated by one among them called the Narrator. <strong>The Narrator sets the mood and tone with their descriptions and the roleplay of the NPCs (non-Protagonist Characters). The Narrator and the Players collaborate, crafting a tale that springs from the collective imagination of everyone involved.</strong> Unlike traditional games, there are no winners or losers in a TTRPG. The goal is for the Group (both Players and Narrator) to immerse themselves in a world they created a world that, while bound by certain rules, encourages unrestricted imaginative play.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Think of the dynamic of a group playing Metanthropes like this: the Narrator is the screenwriter, the director, and the entire supporting cast of a series. The Players, become the Protagonist: the star of the show. But there are no scripted lines or directions for them. They are free to do whatever they want, and the Narrator adapts the story based on their actions. <strong>The Narrator sets the scene, describing the environment, the mood, the setting, and the Characters involved.</strong> Then, it's up to the Players to drive the story forward. They interact with other Characters, the environment, and the world around them. They are responsible for their Protagonist’s inner thoughts and how they translate into dialogue and actions. The Narrator controls the dialogue and actions of all NPCs, including the Antagonists (NPCs who antagonize the Protagonists).</p><p></p>"

There's no right or wrong way to do it. Each Group can develop its own style of roleplaying, tailored to their interests and preferred pace and intensity of the game. <strong>The game unfolds as Players and Narrators engage in collaborative storytelling, improvising on the spot to create a truly unique narrative.</strong> Each story is forged by the preferences of the Group, and the level of commitment and involvement is entirely up to each Player. Each Player should find the level of participation and preparation that triggers their enthusiasm and excitement the most and be vocal about it to their Group. Roleplay can range from an amusing form of entertainment to a transcendental, emotional journey of self-discovery. Let your imagination take over and be inspired to act out scenes, adding greater depth and meaning to the storyline.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Transitioning into your Protagonist is an important process that helps the entire Group stay \"in-Character\".

The very essence of the word \"Metanthrope\" originates from the Greek term \"Μετάνθρωπος\" which translates to \"beyond human.\" These remarkable beings embody the dichotomy between humanity and something more. What sets them apart from ordinary humans are their Metapowers — unique, metaphysical gifts that transform them into something extraordinary. Yet, even with their newfound abilities, Metanthropes remain tethered to the frailties, passions, and flaws of their human nature. In a Session of Metanthropes, Players will embody the transformative journey of an ordinary human who becomes a being of limitless capabilities. <strong>The game poses the question: What would you do with such incredible power?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Anyone, anywhere in the world, regardless of their age, gender, or background, has the potential to become a Metanthrope.</strong> All Metanthropes possess an innate ability to learn new skills and knowledge at an extraordinary pace, while their physiology undergoes remarkable transformations. Elderly Metanthropes are rejuvenated, granted a breath of youth that defies the passing of time. On the other hand, younger Metanthropes mature at an accelerated rate, acquiring wisdom beyond their years. </p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Unlike other supernatural beings of other works of fiction, Metanthropes are not limited by any external source, such as an energy pool, magic, mana, spell slots, or their own vitae. Instead, their only limits are bound by their psychosynthesis and the possibility of some Metapowers backfiring. This grants them the freedom to use their powers as many times as they see fit, with no arbitrary constraints. Metanthropes can harness their Metapowers until they have accomplished their goals and fulfilled their deepest desires. <strong>Each Metanthrope is part of a grander destiny, a bigger picture that unfolds before them.</strong></p><p></p>"

This theme explores the impact of this pivotal transformation on their identity, beliefs, and path in life, shaping the very essence of their existence.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">As Metanthropes grapple with the aftermath of their Metamorphosis, they face a journey of self-discovery and self-acceptance. <strong>This theme explores their personal growth, as they learn to harness their newfound powers, confront their fears and limitations, and find their place in a world that may view them as both saviors and threats.</strong> The Metamorphosis is not just a physical transformation; it is a profound exploration of identity, inner strength, and the potential for both greatness and fallibility.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h3>Metanthropes and the World</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">This theme delves into the complex relationships between Metanthropes and the world around them. It explores the implications of revealing their existence to humanity and the subsequent conflicts that may arise. <strong>Metanthropes have the power to influence and shape their environment, raising questions about the balance between coexistence with humans and the potential consequences of their actions.</strong> Will their interactions with humans, nature, and animals lead to harmony or chaos?</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Beyond the conflicts and implications of revealing their existence, this theme delves into the ethical dilemmas that Metanthropes face. Metanthropes must wrestle with the consequences of their actions and the potential impact on the delicate balance of the world. <strong>It is a theme that explores the price of power, the nature of morality, and the complex interplay between individual agency and collective welfare.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h3>Metanthrope Community</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The interactions within Metanthrope society form another recurring theme. The composition and locations of Metanthrope Coalitions on the planet create opportunities for collaboration, cooperation, or conflict. Stories may revolve around the personal connections of a small group of Metanthropes or explore larger Metanthrope civilizations with established governments, ideologies, and histories. <strong>The theme of Metanthrope society delves into questions of unity, dissonance, power dynamics, and the implications of Metapowers on the social fabric.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Within Metanthrope society, there are struggles for power, ideological clashes, and tensions arising from diverse perspectives. <strong>This theme delves into the intricacies of Metanthrope relationships, highlighting the alliances, rivalries, and personal dramas that unfold within their ranks.</strong> Metanthropes must navigate the complexities of trust, betrayal, and loyalty as they face internal conflicts that mirror the external challenges they encounter. It is a theme that explores the dynamics of community, the quest for identity and belonging, and the ever-shifting balance between unity and individuality.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><h3>Other Metapowered beings</h3><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Metanthropes are not the only Metapowered entities out there. <strong>This theme explores the interactions between Metanthropes and other Metapowered beings, such as extradimensional Spirits, extraterrestrial entities, and other otherworldly Metapowered forces.</strong> Encounters with these NPCs can shape the narrative, introducing unique challenges, alliances, and cosmic mysteries. Stories may unfold within the confines of a single city on Earth or explore the rich intergalactic histories of alien civilizations.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The interactions between Metanthropes and other Metapowered beings give rise to far-reaching consequences. This theme explores the profound encounters with ancient entities and civilizations existing beyond the bounds of human comprehension. Metanthropes venture into uncharted territories, where the boundaries of reality blur and the fabric of existence bends. <strong>It is a theme that delves into existential questions, metaphysical explorations, and the pursuit of knowledge and understanding in the face of the unfathomable.</strong></p><p></p>"
