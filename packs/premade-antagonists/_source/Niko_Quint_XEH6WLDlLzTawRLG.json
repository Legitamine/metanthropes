Ebb And Flow allows you to cause both reductions and increases in the gravity of an area, for the next several minutes. A reduction in gravity causes individuals and objects to float slightly, with movements gaining momentum. Conversely, an increase in gravity suppresses movement, making physical activity laborious within the affected area. Disciplined users can expand the duration, the range and volume of this effect, but those who wield this power carelessly may find themselves unexpectedly grounded by gravity's force.</span></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

Ebb And Flow allows you to cause both reductions and increases in the gravity of an area, for the next several minutes. A reduction in gravity causes individuals and objects to float slightly, with movements gaining momentum. Conversely, an increase in gravity suppresses movement, making physical activity laborious within the affected area. Disciplined users can expand the duration, the range and volume of this effect, but those who wield this power carelessly may find themselves unexpectedly grounded by gravity's force.</span></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

By manipulating the gravitational force acting upon a target, you can effectively immobilize them or alternatively diminish the momentum of their movements. Thrown projectiles might lose their velocity, strikes may lack impact, and even those in freefall may find themselves dragged down. This power grants you mastery over motion itself, akin to a conductor guiding a symphony of celestial forces.&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Increases Willpower by +5% per level\">Determined</abbr>&nbsp;activations may extend Gravitational Anchor&rsquo;s reach and the number and maximum weight of targets. However, the delicacy of this power is matched only by its potential dangers, as excessive manipulation could leave the Controller themselves feeling burdened by the very forces they wield.</span></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

By manipulating the gravitational force acting upon a target, you can effectively immobilize them or alternatively diminish the momentum of their movements. Thrown projectiles might lose their velocity, strikes may lack impact, and even those in freefall may find themselves dragged down. This power grants you mastery over motion itself, akin to a conductor guiding a symphony of celestial forces.&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Increases Willpower by +5% per level\">Determined</abbr>&nbsp;activations may extend Gravitational Anchor&rsquo;s reach and the number and maximum weight of targets. However, the delicacy of this power is matched only by its potential dangers, as excessive manipulation could leave the Controller themselves feeling burdened by the very forces they wield.</span></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

By manipulating the gravitational force acting upon a target, you can effectively immobilize them or alternatively diminish the momentum of their movements. Thrown projectiles might lose their velocity, strikes may lack impact, and even those in freefall may find themselves dragged down. This power grants you mastery over motion itself, akin to a conductor guiding a symphony of celestial forces.&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Increases Willpower by +5% per level\">Determined</abbr>&nbsp;activations may extend Gravitational Anchor&rsquo;s reach and the number and maximum weight of targets. However, the delicacy of this power is matched only by its potential dangers, as excessive manipulation could leave the Controller themselves feeling burdened by the very forces they wield.</span></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

By creating a gravitational epicenter within a targeted area, you can cause an abrupt shift in the local gravitational forces. Individuals in proximity to the epicenter will be irresistibly drawn toward it, as if the very earth itself craves their presence. The strongest among them might resist the pull, but most will be inexorably drawn toward the epicenter's heart. Skillful Controllers can extend the reach of this effect, targeting additional, and heavier targets and even employing it from a distance. Yet, a mistimed attempt could result in the Controller inadvertently becoming the epicenter of the gravitational pull, briefly tethered to the ground.</span></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

Through Acceleration Absorption, you can absorb the speed of other perceptible individuals and add it to your own. Alternatively, you can reactively absorb the acceleration of falling objects or individuals, reducing the force of impact and allowing you and others to fall from great heights unharmed.&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Which part of my Turn does it take to activate this effect\"><abbr title=\"Which part of my Turn does it take to activate this effect\">Activation</abbr></abbr>&nbsp;of Acceleration Absorption occurs from a distance, and precise activations can amplify its effect in various ways, but any failed attempts might cause your body to shake uncontrollably for a minute.</span></em></p>"

By unlocking the first level of this Metapower, you become able to accurately estimate the speed of something just by looking at it. Through Acceleration Absorption, you can absorb the speed of other perceptible individuals and add it to your own. Alternatively, you can reactively absorb the acceleration of falling objects or individuals, reducing the force of impact and allowing you and others to fall from great heights unharmed.&nbsp;<abbr title=\"Which part of my Turn does it take to activate this effect\"><abbr title=\"Which part of my Turn does it take to activate this effect\">Activation</abbr></abbr>&nbsp;of Acceleration Absorption occurs from a distance, and precise activations can amplify its effect in various ways, but any failed attempts might cause your body to shake uncontrollably for a minute.</span></em></p>"
