You can uncover hidden areas, sense the presence of invisible entities and interdimensional beings, and detect when someone is shadowing you. Additionally, while Feel the Unseen is active, you gain insight into the psychic conditions of those around you, providing a glimpse into their souls. This remarkable ability warns you like a gut feeling of what lies hidden around you, causing unseen presences to brighten with colored auras. The extent of Feel the Unseen's capabilities depends on the skill of the Clairvoyant. Skillful attempts will reveal more secrets, as new colorful auras will be included in your mind's eye. However, careless attempts may temporarily blind you for a minute. With Feel the Unseen, you become a master of uncovering secrets and untangling the mysteries that surround you.</span></em></p>"

However, Powerful Psyche is not always active, as it requires effort from the Clairvoyant to activate and may come with some risks as well. Concentrated activations can extend the duration of the effect and boost the resistances provided, but half-hearted attempts might leave the Metanthrope feeling euphoric and reckless for a short period. With Powerful Psyche, you become a bastion of mental fortitude, shielded against psychic intrusions and capable of maintaining perfect focus even in the face of adversity.</span></em></p>"
