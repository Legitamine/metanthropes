### Known Issues
- Automatic XP Calculation for Characteristics and Stats assumes that you progressed your Characteristic first, otherwise it will spent more XP than what it should. 
	- Workaround: Use the Spent XP manual input field to adjust the XP spent for the Stat.
- Metapowers tab in your Character Sheet displays the Current value of the Stat for that Metapower's Activation. If any Stat is changed, or a Roll is made, the values in the Metapowers Tab become null.
	- Workaround: Close your Character Sheet and re-open, the correct values will be displayed.
- Combat: Hidden Combatants are not rolling hidden Initiative correctly.
	- Workaround: The Narrator should manually ensure their rolls are hidden before rolling for Initiative.
