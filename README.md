# Metanthropes

**Metanthropes** - comes from Greek \*'Μετα-Άνθρωπος' **'Beyond-Human'\*** - is a new, easy to learn, classless, setting-flexible, d100 system.

Metanthropes features **over 500 unique abilities**, called **Metapowers**: unique, metaphysical gifts that transform ordinary humans into something extraordinary.

This System is the official Metanthropes System for Foundry VTT. It is available, free of charge, for all Foundry VTT users. It includes demo content, to check out some example Metanthrope builds and playtest. It also comes with Journals to help you learn how to play.

A list of Premium Modules for Foundry VTT is available [on our store](https://metanthropes.com/store).

## Early Access

Metanthropes is in **Early Access** - although functional, it does not fully represent the envisioned scope of the project.

Early Access is considered stable enough to run Sagas (Campaigns), as well as to playtest new features. We offer support to all Narrators [via our Discord!](https://metanthropes.com/discord).
