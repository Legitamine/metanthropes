# Metanthropes RPG System for FoundryVTT
This is the official Metanthropes RPG system for Foundry VTT.

- This project is in no way affiliated with or supported by Foundry VTT.
- For more information about Metanthropes RPG visit https://metanthropes.com

## Installation
This is a work in progress and is not ready for general use. Installation instructions will be placed here when the system is ready. Please do not use this system for your games, unless you want to help playtest and know what you're doing.

## Supported Modules

This System aims to utilize the latest and best in Foundry VTT. Currently offers support for the latest stable Foundry VTT version 10.291

To get the best experience while playing Metanthropes RPG, we recommend to install the following fully supported modules:

- Dice So Nice: https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dice-so-nice
- Drag Ruler: https://foundryvtt.com/packages/drag-ruler 

### Known Issues

- Automatic XP Calculation for Characteristics and Stats assumes that you progressed your Characteristic first, otherwise it will spent more XP than what it should. 
	- Workaround: Use the Spent XP manual input field to adjust the XP spent for the Stat.
- Combat: Roll for Initiative is not working properly. 
	- Workaround: Roll a Stat Roll manually instead and The Narrator will adjust the combat order manually.
