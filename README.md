# Metanthropes

Metanthropes (from Greek, translates to ‘beyond-human’) is a new, easy to learn, classless, setting-flexible, d100 system, featuring over 500 unique abilities, called Metapowers: unique, metaphysical gifts that transform ordinary humans into something extraordinary.

This System is the official Metanthropes System for Foundry VTT. It is available, free of charge, for all Foundry VTT users. It includes demo content, to check out some example Metanthrope builds and playtest.

- We would love to hear your opinion and feedback! Join our community [on Discord!](https://metanthropes.com/discord)

## Early Access

Metanthropes is in Early Access - although fully functional, it does not fully represent the envisioned scope of the project.

Early Access is considered stable enough to run Sagas (Campaigns), as well as to playtest new features. We offer support to all Narrators [via our Discord!](https://metanthropes.com/discord).

## Roadmap

Briefly, we are working torwards the following milestones:

-   Officially Support the full Ruleset for Metanthropes, including automating the vast majority of the game mechanics. With Metanthropes v1.0 are in the process of restructuring the codebase to support the full ruleset. We expect to have this milestone completed by the end of 2024.
-   Make Combat as immersive as possible, with auto-applying damage/healing, targeting via measured templates and controlling all types of effects to Actors. Although the majority of automations is planned for the v1.0 release, some features have been pushed back to align with the release of Foundry VTT version 13+.
-   Fully automate the activation of Metapowers, including unique audio and visual effects.
-   Synchronize your Protagonist details with our website, for off-line viewing and editing between Sessions, without having to open Foundry VTT.
